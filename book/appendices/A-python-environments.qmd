# Virtual environments

This hands-on lesson gives a brief introduction to Python virtual environments.

## Learning objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:


## Environments: what and why

Environments are a way to keep the packages and Python versions you use for different projects organized. 

![Some environments can have lots of packages and dependencies, while others can keep it simple. ](/book/appendices/images/appendix-A/project-cats.png){width=60% fig-align="center"}

The main reasons to create an environment for each of your projects are:

- To not interfere with your computerâ€™s pre-installed Python
- Manage dependency conflicts for different projects
- Reproducibility! Being able to share your code and what it needs to run it with others

What these are.

## Conda environments

[Conda](https://conda.org) is an environment *and* package management system: 
it can both create and administer the environments *and* install compatible versions of software and their dependencies.
Environments created with conda are usually called **conda environments**. A conda environment doesn't need to be a Python environment, conda can manage packages for any programming language.

## Conda channels

**Conda channels** are the remote locations where packages are stored. Think of them as shops for getting packages.
By default, packages are downloaded to your computer and updated from the [conda default channel](https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/). But there are others! [Conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org) and [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io) are two popular ones.
We can choose which conda channel to install a package from. 

## `pip`

`pip` is a *package* management system *only* for Python. We can use it to install packages from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org). We can use `pip` inside a conda environment when a package is not available from a conda channel.
