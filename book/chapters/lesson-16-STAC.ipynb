        "So far in our course we have obtained data in two ways: by downloading it directly from the data provider or by obtaining a URL from a data repository. \n",
        "This can be a convenient way to access targeted datasets, often usign graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for data discovery and filtering.\n",
        "However, relying on clicking and copy-pasting addresses and file names can make our workflows more error-prone and less reproducible. \n",
        "In particular, satellites around the world produce terabytes of new data daily and manually browsing through data repositories can it make difficult to access this data. \n",
        "Moreover, it can be inconvenient to learn a new way to access data from every single big data provider.\n",
        "This is where STAC comes in.\n",

        "\n",
        "In the next classes we'll be working with the [Microsoft's Planetary Computer (MPC)](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com) STAC API. \n",

        "## Item, collection, and catalog\n",
        "The **STAC item** (or just item) is the building block of a STAC. \n",
        "An item is a GeoJSON feature with additional fields that make it easier to find it as we look for data across catalogs. \n",
        "\n",
        "An item holds two types of information:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Metadata:** The metadata for a STAC item includes core identifying information (such as ID, geometry, bounding box, and date), and additional properties (for example, place of collection). \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Assets:** Assets are links to the actual data of the item (for example, links to the spectral bands of a satellite image.)\n",
        "\n",
        "STAC items can be grouped into **STAC collections**. \n",
        "For example, while a single satellite scene (at a single time and location) would constitue an item, scenes across time and location from the same satellite can be orgnanized in a collection. \n",
        "Finally, multiple collections can be organized into a single **STAC catalog**. \n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we'll be accessing the MPC STAC catalog. Two of its collections are the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) colelction and the Copernicus Digital Elevation Model (DEM) colleciton.
