This quiz has a mix of fill in the blank, multiple choice, trur or false and short answer questions. 

## üß≠ Coordinate Reference Systems

1. A _____________ is a system used to represent locations on Earth as coordinates.  

2. The Earth is best modeled as:  
   a) A perfect sphere  
   b) A cube  
   c) An ellipsoid  
   d) A flat surface  

3. *True or False:*  All datums are global ‚Äî the same one can be used for any region without loss of accuracy.  

4. Name one key difference between a *geographic CRS* and a *projected CRS*.

5. The main purpose of a projection is to:  
   a) Make Earth‚Äôs 3D coordinates more accurate
   b) Convert a 3D surface into a 2D map  
   c) Increase the precision of GPS signals  
   d) Remove all distortions from maps  

6. *True or False:* Every projection perfectly preserves area, distance, and angles.  

7. A projected CRS expresses coordinates in linear units such as __________.  


## üìç Vector Data

8. Which of the following is *not* one of the three core vector data types?  
   a) Points  
   b) Lines  
   c) Polygons  
   d) Rasters  

9. A single observation such as a tree location or an animal sighting would be represented as a __________ feature.  

10. What kind of landscape feature could be represented as a line?

11. A __________ represents a geographic feature made up of several disconnected polygons that together form one unit (for example, a country with many islands).  

12. In vector data, attributes are:  
   a) Geometric shapes of features  
   b) Tables describing each feature‚Äôs properties  
   c) Projection parameters  
   d) File extensions used to store geometry  

13. All files that make up a shapefile must have the same name (different extensions) and be stored in the same directory.  

14. *True or False:* A single shapefile can only contain one vector type.
