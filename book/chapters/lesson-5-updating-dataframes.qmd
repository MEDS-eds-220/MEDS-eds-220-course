## About the data

For the next plots we will use the  Palmer Penguins dataset @palmerpenguins developed by Drs. Allison Horst, Alison Hill and Kristen Gorman. This dataset contains size measurements for three penguin species in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica  during 2007, 2008, and 2009. 

![The Palmer Archipelago penguins. Artwork by Dr. Allison Horst.](/book/images/lesson-5/penguins-logo.png)

The dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns. We can see the head of the dataset below:

```{python}
#| echo: false

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

URL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/main/inst/extdata/penguins.csv'
penguins = pd.read_csv(URL)

penguins.head()
```

## Adding a single column...

Let us start by importing the packages we will use in this lesson and loading the data:

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import random  # Used for randomly sampling integers

# Set the seed
random.seed(42)

# Import data
URL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/main/inst/extdata/penguins.csv'
penguins = pd.read_csv(URL)
```

### ... using dictionary-like syntax
The simplest syntax to add a new column to a `pandas.DataFrame` is 

```python
df['new_col_name'] = new_column_values
```
where the `new_column_values` could be: 

- a `pandas.Series` or a `numpy.array` of the same length as the data frame, or
- a single scalar.

If the column name exists, the existing column will be updated.

Remember a `pandas.DataFrame` can be seen as a dictionary of its columns. This syntax for adding a new column to a `pandas.DataFrame` is the same as adding a new key-value pair to a dictionary:
```python
# Add a new key-value pair to a dictionary
dict[new_key] = new_value
```

#### Example

We want to create a new column where the body mass is in kilograms instead of grams, then we need to divide each value in the `body_mass_g` by 1000. 

```{python}
# Add new column body_mass_kg 
penguins['body_mass_kg'] = penguins.body_mass_g/1000

# Confirm the new column is in the data frame
print("body_mass_kg is in the data frame's columns: ", 'body_mass_kg' in penguins.columns)

# Look at the new column
penguins.head()
```

### ...using the `assign()` method

We can also create or update an existing column using the [`assign()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.assign.html) method for `pandas.DataFrames`. The general syntax is:
```python
df = df.assign(new_col_name=new_column_values)
```
Notice the new column names are not strings, we declare them as if we were creating variables.

This way of creating a new column, unlike the dictionary-like syntax, does not modify the data frame in-place. This can be useful for chaining operations:

```{python}
(penguins.assign(bill_length_cm=penguins.bill_length_mm/10)
        .plot(kind='scatter',
              x='bill_length_cm', 
              y='body_mass_g')
    )
```

### ...at a specific location

The new column was addedby default at the end of the data frame. If we want to create a new column and insert it at a particular position we can use the data frame method [`insert()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.insert.html):
```python
df.insert(loc=integer_index,  # Location of new column
          column='new_col_name', 
          value=new_col_values)
```

#### Example

Let's give each penguin observation a unique identifier as a three digit number and add this column at the beginning of the data frame.

```{python}
# Create random 3-digit codes
codes = random.sample(range(100,1000), len(penguins))  # Sampling w/o replacement

# Insert codes at the front of data frame
penguins.insert(loc=0,  # Index
                column='id_code',
                value=codes)
        
penguins.head()
```

<!--

df.columns.get_loc()
-->


## Adding multiple columns

We can also use the [`assign()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.assign.html) method to create or update multiple columns in the same call. The general syntax is:
```python
df = df.assign(new_col1_name=new_col1_values, 
               new_col2_name=new_col2_values)
```
Remember this method does not modify the data frame, so you will need to reassign the output to the original data frame to update it.

#### Example

Suppose we want to add these new columns: 

- flipper length converted from mm to cm, and
- a code representing the observer.

We can add these columns to `penguins` using `assign()`:

```{python}
# Create columns with observer codes and flipper length in cm
penguins = penguins.assign(flipper_length_cm=penguins.flipper_length_mm/10, 
                           observer=random.choices(['A','B','C'],  # Sample with replacement
                                                    k=len(penguins))
                          )
# Examine result
penguins.head()
```

## Removing columns

We can remove columns using the [`drop()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html) method for `pandas.Data.Frames`, the syntax is:
```python
df = df.drop(columns=col_names)
```
where `col_names` can be a single column name (string) or a list of column names. Notice again that the `drop()` method does not modify the data frame in place, so you need to reassign the output.


#### Example

Now that we updated the units for flipper length and body mass, it makes sense to remove the previous columns to avoid duplicate information. We can do this using `drop()`:

```{python}
# Remove duplicate length and mass measurements
penguins = penguins.drop(columns=['flipper_length_mm','body_mass_g'])

# Confirm result
print(penguins.columns)
```

## Updating values

Sometimes we want to update a specific value in our data frame. We'll review some methods and best practices to do that in this section. 

### A single value
We can access a single value in a `pandas.DataFrame` using the locators

- [`at[]`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.at.html) to select by labels, or
- [`iat[]`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.at.html) to select by position. 


The syntax for `at[]` is:
```python
df.at[single_index_value, 'column_name']
```
Think of `at[]` as the equivalent to `loc[]` when trying to access a single value.

#### Example
For this example, let's first update the index of the data frame to be the `id_code` column:

```{python}
penguins = penguins.set_index('id_code')
penguins
```

If we want to know what was the bill length of the penguin which has ID number 859, we can directly access that information using `at[]`:

```{python}
# Check bil length of penguin with ID 859
penguins.at[859, 'bill_length_mm']
```

We get this bill length is an NA. Maybe we want to update it to 38.3 mm. We can do this with `at[]` too:
```{python}
# Correct bill length value of penguin with ID 859
penguins.at[859,'bill_length_mm'] = 38.3

# Confirm value was updated
penguins.loc[859]
```

If we want to access or update a single value by position we use the `iat[]` locator. The syntax for `iat[]` is:
```python
df.iat[index_integer_location, column_integer_location]
```
This is the same way you would index entries in a matrix. You may find it useful to think of `iat[]` as the equivalent of `iloc[]` to access a single value in the data frame.

Obtaining the location of a specific column within the column list can be prone to error if we do it 'by hand'. If we need to obtain this index, we can dynamically get the location this way:
```python
penguins.columns.get_loc('column_name')
```

:::{.callout-tip}
## Check-in
a. Obtain the 

Use `iat[]` to access the same bill length value for the penguin with ID 859 and revert it back to an NA. Confirm your update using `iloc[]`.
:::

<!--
```{python}
# Set to NaN using iat
penguins.iat[3,2] = np.nan

# Confirm using iloc
penguins.iloc[3]
```
-->

### Multiple values in a column

What if we want to update multiple values in a column? We'll cover two cases: with a condition on the column values and by selecting a few values to update. 


#### By condition

Often we want to create a new column where the new values depend on conditions on another column's values. 

**Example**

Suppose we want to classify all penguins with body mass less than 3kg as small, penguins with body mass greater or equal than 3kg but less than 5kg as medium, and those with body mass greater or equal than 5kg as large. One way to add this information in a new column using `numpy.select()`:

```{python}
# create a list with the conditions
conditions = [penguins.body_mass_kg < 3, 
              (3 <= penguins.body_mass_kg) & (penguins.body_mass_kg < 5),
              5 <= penguins.body_mass_kg]

# create a list with the choices
choices = ["small",
           "medium",
           "large"]

# add the selections using np.select
# default = value for anything that falls outside conditions
penguins['size'] = np.select(conditions, choices, default=np.nan)

penguins.head()
```

https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.select.html
-->

#### By selecting values

When we only want to update some values in a column we can do this by selecting this data using `loc` (if selecting by labels) or `iloc` (if selecting by position). The general sytanx for updating data with `loc` is:
```python
# modifies data in place
df.loc[row_selection, col_name] = new_values
```
where 

- `row_selection` is the rows we want to update, 
- `col_name` is a single column name, and 
- `new_values` is the new value or values we want. If using multiple values, then `new_values` must be of the same length as the number of rows selected, 

**Example**

Suppose we want to update the "Male" value in the sex column to "M".

```{python}
# select rows with sex=male and update the values in the sex column
penguins.loc[penguins.sex=='Male', 'sex'] = 'M'

# check changes
penguins.head()
```


## `SettingWithCopyWarning`

Suppose we want to similarly update the "Female" values in the sex column to "F". This is an example of another way we might try to do it, but it won't update our data frame:

```{python}
# select rows and columns with two selection brackets [][] (chained indexing), instead of loc[]
# then trying to update the values
penguins[penguins.sex=='Female']['sex'] = 'F'
```

When we select the data we want to update using **chained indexing** (`[][]`) instead of `loc[]` we get a `SettingWithCopyWarning`. Wit this warning, `pandas` is trying to alert us to a potential bug. In this case that we did not update our data frame:

```{python}
# no values were updated
penguins.sex.unique()
```

::: {.callout-warning}
The `SettingWithCopyWarning` is letting us know our code is ambiguous and we need to double check the code is doing what we intended. In the words of the [`pandas` documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#why-does-assignment-fail-when-using-chained-indexing):

> assigning to the product of chained indexing has inherently unpredictable results.

<!-- MAKE SOME DIAGRAMS LIKE DATAQUEST https://www.dataquest.io/blog/settingwithcopywarning/ -->

To see what is going on we need to understand that some `pandas` operations return a view to your data, while others return a copy of your data.

- **Views** are actual subsets of the original data, when we update them, we are modifying the original data frame. 

- **Copies** are unique objects, independent of our original data frames. When we update a copy we are not modifying the original data frame. 

Depending on what we are trying to do we might want to modify the original data frame or we might want to modify a copy. 

**Check-in** 

Update the "Female" values in the `penguins` data frame to "F". Don't use chained indexing

```{python}
# no chained indexing in assignment = no warning
penguins.loc[penguins.sex=='Female','sex'] = 'F'

# notice the values were updated now
penguins.head()
```


#### Another `SettingWithCopyWarning`

Another common situation where `SettingWithCopyWarning` comes up is when we try to update a subset of a data frame we have already stored in a new variable. 

**Example** 

Suppose we only want to use data from Biscoe island and, after doing some analyses, we want to add a new column to it:

```{python}
# select penguins from Biscoe island
biscoe = penguins[penguins.island=='Biscoe']

# 50 lines of code here

# add a column, we get a warning
biscoe['sample_col'] = 100
```

It might not seem like it, but we have a chained assignment here too. We essentialy wrote:

```python
penguins[penguins.island=='Biscoe']['sample_col'] = 100
```

To fix this we can **take control of the copy-view situation and explicitely ask for a copy of the dataset when subsetting the data**. Use the `copy()` method to do this:

```{python}
# make sure you get a new data frame with penguins from Biscoe island
biscoe = penguins[penguins.island=='Biscoe'].copy()

# add a column, no warning
biscoe['sample_col'] = 100
```

Now we are sure we did not modify our initial data, but rather the `biscoe` data frame:

```{python}
# new column is there
biscoe.head()
```

```{python}
# and we are sure our original df wasn't modified
penguins.head()
```


The `SettingWithCopyWarning` can often be tricky, there are also false positives and false negatives. Avoiding chained indexing and making a copy of your data frame subset whenever possible will save you from the usual pitfalls.
