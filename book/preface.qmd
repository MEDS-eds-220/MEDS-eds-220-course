# About

**Welcome to the 'EDS 220 - Working with Environmental Datasets' course notes!**

Designed for the [UCSB Masters in Environmental Data Science (MEDS)](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science), this course will guide you through widely used environmental data formats and Python libraries for analyzing diverse environmental datasets.

The notes are organized following the increasing dimensions of different environmental datasets, from familiar tabular data to intricate multi-dimensional arrays. Through hands-on code and activities, you'll analyze real-world environmental datasets sourced from leading open data repositories and cloud platforms.

**Who is this course for?** 
EDS 220 is tailored for beginner Python programmers eager to deepen their skills. If you‚Äôre familiar with the basics of Python and have experience working in Jupyter notebooks, you're in the right place. 
You are also encouraged to bring along your git skills and GitHub profile, ready to practice the essential `git pull` - `git push` workflow as you progress.

Overall, these notes are just the beginning!
They offer a solid foundation but are, inevitably, a partial exposition of the incredibly vast ecosystem of data formats, repositories, and Python tools available in environmental data science. 
By the end of this course, you'll have a strong grasp of the fundamentals and also the confidence to dive deeper into using Python for environmental data science and continue your MEDS journey.
