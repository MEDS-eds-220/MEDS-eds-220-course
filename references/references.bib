                  Endangered and listed species are often a catalyst for research, conservation and planning. Here, a novel, open data set summarizing all the reported diet and prey items for all endangered, terrestrial dryland species listed in central California is provided as a case study. These data highlight the critical need for sharing data rapidly and transparently to support ecological solution science.
                
                
                  Systematic review practices were used, data were compiled and the resulting data set was published in an open access, federated data repository using ecological metadata language and FAIR principles. The goal is to show that these data can now be used and analysed by applied ecologists and stakeholders to identify not only the habitat and spatial needs for the endangered species but to widen the conservation protection net to include prey species.
                
                
                  Conserving viable habitat with higher likelihoods of prey presence will better support conservation of endangered species, and data describing reported species are a crucial first step. Interactive tables, local species lists and maps are simple tools that can now be developed regionally with open data such as these.},

Records were imported into R using the rgbif package and cleaned with the coordinateCleaner package to remove occurrence data with likely errors. Environmental data include bioclimatic variables from WorldClim (www.worldclim.org), landcover and NDVI data from MODIS and the LPDAAC (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/), elevation data from the USGS (https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/542aebf9e4b057766eed286a), and distance to the nearest road from the census bureau's TIGER/Line road shapefile (https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html).

	abstract = {Coral reefs are threatened by climate change, thus effective policies and management require spatial prioritization for conservation investments. Our aim was to develop a spatially explicit ecological model to predict current (2020) and future (2050) numbers of coral taxa at moderate scales (i.e., {\textasciitilde}6 km2). Our machine learning predictive models of coral community attributes in 7039 mapped reef cells in the western Indian Ocean were based on 35 spatially complete influential environmental proxies trained with {\textasciitilde}1000 field surveys. Four models explored: influences of climate change, water quality, direct human-resource extraction, and variable selection processes on numbers of coral taxa. Two predictive models examined the predictions of all variables and compared them to a variable-restricted climate change (8 commonly used variables) and human influence model (9 variables). The most frequently selected temperature variables in all models were the median, skewness, excess heat, rate of temperature rise, and kurtosis. However, non-temperature variables of observer, depth, wave energy, dissolved oxygen, salinity, chlorophyll-a, calcite concentrations, sunlight, and net primary productivity were frequently as important or stronger. Human influences of national jurisdiction, distance to people, sediments, and nutrients were selected but less influential when compared to the climate or the full variable models. Comparing models indicated the importance of variable pre-selection processes and variable interactions in predicting climate change and human influences on coral diversity. Comparing climate scenarios in the moderate RCP2.6 and extreme RCP8.5 emission scenarios indicated fewer losses in coral taxa (RCP2.6 = 5.2\%, RCP8.5 = 8.1\% respectively) relative to cover (RCP2.6 = 14\%, RCP8.5 = 34\%) over the 30 years. Excess heat and rate of temperature rise variables used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) forecasts predict more negative effects on corals than our four models but shown here to have low to modest effects.},
