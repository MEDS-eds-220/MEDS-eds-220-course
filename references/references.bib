	abstract = {Coral reefs are threatened by climate change, thus effective policies and management require spatial prioritization for conservation investments. Our aim was to develop a spatially explicit ecological model to predict current (2020) and future (2050) numbers of coral taxa at moderate scales (i.e., {\textasciitilde}6 km2). Our machine learning predictive models of coral community attributes in 7039 mapped reef cells in the western Indian Ocean were based on 35 spatially complete influential environmental proxies trained with {\textasciitilde}1000 field surveys. Four models explored: influences of climate change, water quality, direct human-resource extraction, and variable selection processes on numbers of coral taxa. Two predictive models examined the predictions of all variables and compared them to a variable-restricted climate change (8 commonly used variables) and human influence model (9 variables). The most frequently selected temperature variables in all models were the median, skewness, excess heat, rate of temperature rise, and kurtosis. However, non-temperature variables of observer, depth, wave energy, dissolved oxygen, salinity, chlorophyll-a, calcite concentrations, sunlight, and net primary productivity were frequently as important or stronger. Human influences of national jurisdiction, distance to people, sediments, and nutrients were selected but less influential when compared to the climate or the full variable models. Comparing models indicated the importance of variable pre-selection processes and variable interactions in predicting climate change and human influences on coral diversity. Comparing climate scenarios in the moderate RCP2.6 and extreme RCP8.5 emission scenarios indicated fewer losses in coral taxa (RCP2.6 = 5.2\%, RCP8.5 = 8.1\% respectively) relative to cover (RCP2.6 = 14\%, RCP8.5 = 34\%) over the 30 years. Excess heat and rate of temperature rise variables used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) forecasts predict more negative effects on corals than our four models but shown here to have low to modest effects.},

	abstract = {The data in this data release are from an effort focused on understanding social vulnerability to water insecurity, resiliency demonstrated by institutions, and conflict or crisis around water resource management. This data release focuses on the conflict in crisis aspects of work. To characterize crisis a dual-prong, qualitative triangulation was used to identify and provide context for water conflict and other water-related events in the Colorado River Basin. The first prong was observation by research team members of nine public, recorded meetings of water control boards and official organizations in the Colorado River Basin. Discourse analysis was then used to identify major themes in these meetings, and integrated into data from the second prong of this project. The second prong was a search, cataloguing, and contextualization of articles from newspapers describing water-related events in geographic areas in the Basin based on methods established by Dr. Nathan Eidem. USGS applied this methodology to a new time period of data to extend the work. This kind of approach has value for examining Crisis on a continual basis toward identification of hotspots from conflict, identifying primary stakeholders, and who experiences crises. This resulting dataset catalogues events in the Colorado River Basin (particularly the Upper Colorado River Basin in most cases) from 2005 - 2021. This table extends the the Upper Colorado Events Database which catalogues simiar events from 1970 - 2005. Events are defined as any interaction between parties that is action-defined, recorded, and made available to the public. The criteria for inclusion we used for the LexisNexis search is as follows: each event must be driven by some aspect or dimension of freshwater resources and occur within the study area. Each event is described comprehensively and coded with themes that correspond to themes from the first prong to provide proof of each themes contribution to conflict in the Basin (see Colorado River Basin Water Conflict Table). Given resource constraints some events were not fully coded but are included in the Uncoded Events table as a resource to other researchers in the future.},
