This dataset is stored at ScienceBase,a digital repository from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) created to share scientific data products and USGS resources.\nThe dataset is a CSV file containing information about conflict or crisis around water resource management in the Colorado River Basin. The Colorado River Basin, inhabited by several Native American tribes for centuries, is a crucial water source in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, supporting over 40 million people, extensive agricultural lands, and diverse ecosystems. Its management is vital due to the region‚Äôs arid climate and the competing demands for water, leading to significant challenges related to water allocation and conservation.\n\n\n\nColorado River Basin.

    "text": "Welcome to the ‚ÄòEDS 220 - Working with Environmental Datasets‚Äô course notes!\nDesigned for the UCSB Masters in Environmental Data Science (MEDS), this course will guide you through widely used environmental data formats and Python libraries for analyzing diverse environmental datasets.\nThe notes are organized following the increasing dimensions of different environmental datasets, from familiar tabular data to intricate multi-dimensional arrays. Through hands-on code and activities, you‚Äôll analyze real-world environmental datasets sourced from leading open data repositories and cloud platforms.\nWho is this course for? EDS 220 is tailored for beginner Python programmers eager to deepen their skills. If you‚Äôre familiar with the basics of Python and have experience working in Jupyter notebooks, you‚Äôre in the right place.

    "text": "This hands-on lesson gives a brief introduction to Conda environments, focusing on practical usage. You can use this lesson as a standalone introduction to environments, ideally preceding the installation of the course-specific environment (see Setup section). The last section includes a table with the Conda commands used in this lesson for quick reference.\n\n\nBy the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n\nDescribe what Conda environments are and their role in managing Python packages and dependencies\nUse standard Conda commands to list, activate, deactivate, create, and delete environments\nBuild Conda environments and install packages using the command line\nGenerate and edit a .yml file with environment specifications to enhance project reproducibility\n\n\n\n\nEnvironments are a way to keep the packages and Python versions you use for different projects organized.\n\n\n\nSome environments can have lots of packages and dependencies, while others can keep it simple.\n\n\nThe main reasons to create an environment for each of your projects are:\n\nTo not interfere with your computer‚Äôs pre-installed Python\nPackages usually depend on other packages to work properly, this is called a package dependency. Dependencies across different packages need to be carefully managed and may potentially be different across projects.\nReproducibility! Being able to share your code and what it needs to run it with others\n\n\n\n\nConda is an environment and package management system: it can both create and administer the environments and install compatible versions of software and their dependencies within an environment.\nEnvironments created with Conda are usually called Conda environments. A Conda environment doesn‚Äôt need to be a Python environment, Conda can manage packages for any programming language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConda channels are the remote locations where packages are stored. Think of them as shops for getting packages. By default, packages are downloaded to your computer and updated from the conda default channel. But there are others! Conda-forge and bioconda are two popular ones. We can choose which Conda channel to install a package from.\n\n\n\npip is a package management system only for Python. We can use it to install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI). We can use pip inside a Conda environment when a package is not available from a Conda channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following exercises will guide you through the basic commands to work with Conda environments. Unless otherwise specified, all the commands should be run in the command line. For a deeper dive after completing this introduction, check out the Conda documentation.\n\n\nTo list all the Conda environments available in your computer and their location we use:\nconda env list\nThe output should look something like this:\n# conda environments:\n#\nbase                  *  /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3\neds220-env               /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/eds220-env\nNotice the file path next to the environment name. This is the absolute path to the environment‚Äôs installation directory on my local machine. This is where Conda has created the environment and stored the packages!\nWhat is my currently active environment?\n\nWhen you run conda env list, the asterisk next to the environment path indicates which environment is active. In the previous example, I am using the base Python environment.\nThe currently active environment also appears in the terminal in parenthesis at the beginning of each line, something like this:\n\n(base) my-computer:MEDS-eds-220-course galaz-garcia$\n\n\n\nTo create a new environment called test-env wiht a specific version of Python (in this case Python 3.11) we simply run:\nconda create --name test-env python=3.11\nWhen you run this command, it will print out information about the packages that will be installed and ask you whether to proceed or not. Type y and press enter to create the environment and install the packages.\nIf we don‚Äôt include a Python version, the command conda create --name test-env python will install the most recent version of Python.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nCheck whether the new test-env environment is listed by Conda. Is it activated or not?\n\n\n\n\n\nTo activate the test-env environment we use the command\nconda activate test-env\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nVerify that test-env is now your current environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see which packages are installed within the currently active environment we run:\nconda list\nThe output will be a long list that looks something like this:\n# packages in environment at /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/test-env:\n#\n# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel\nbzip2                     1.0.8                h6c40b1e_6  \npip                       24.2            py312hecd8cb5_0  \nsqlite                    3.45.3               h6c40b1e_0  \n[...]\nThe name and version of each installed package in the environment appear in their respective columns. The ‚ÄòBuild‚Äô column shows a build string for each package. This string encodes important information about how the package was compiled, including any updates or changes made without altering the package version. It also reflects any compatibility or performance optimizations that were integrated during the build process.\nFor example, the same package with the same version might have different builds (and therefore different build strings) depending on whether it was installed on macOS, Windows, or Linux. This difference arises because the package may need to be compiled differently to optimize performance and ensure compatibility with each operating system.\nThe channel column shows the source from which the package was downloaded and installed. In this example the entries on this column are blank, signaling these packages were downloaded from the defeault Conda channel. We‚Äôll see other channels appear in the next examples.\nWe can also request information about a specific package. For example, if we run\nconda list pip\nwe obtain only the information about the pip package:\n# packages in environment at /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/test-env:\n#\n# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel\npip                       24.2            py312hecd8cb5_0  \nWe can use the same command to verify whether a package is installed. For example, if we run\nconda list numpy\nwe will get empty columns:\n# packages in environment at /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/test-env:\n#\n# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel\nbecause the numpy package is not intalled in this environment.\n\n\n\nSuppose we want to install numpy in our currently active environment test-env. To do this we can simply use the command:\nconda install numpy\nSince we have not specified another channel, this command will install numpy from the default channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nVerify that numpy is now installed.\n\n\nNow, suppose we want to install rioxarray, this is a Python package for raster data analysis. This is a relatively new package, so it might not be available from the default Conda channels. A sensible measure would be to first look if rioxarray is available in the defaults channels, which we can do by running:\nconda search rioxarray\nThe output will look similar to\nLoading channels: done\nNo match found for: rioxarray. Search: *rioxarray*\n\nPackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:\n\n  - rioxarray\n\nCurrent channels:\n\n  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/osx-64\n  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/noarch\n  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/osx-64\n  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/noarch\n\nTo search for alternate channels that may provide the Conda package you're\nlooking for, navigate to\n\n    https://anaconda.org\n\nand use the search bar at the top of the page.\nAs stated, rioxarray is not available on the default channels for my Conda installation. Notice a couple of the channels it is seraching on are specific to macOS (my current operating system). The last two channels are actually channels for R packages. If we had tried to install rioxarray using conda install rioxarray we would have obtained an error message with similar information (you can try it if you want!).\nWe may have better luck searching for rioxarray in the conda-forge channel, which we can do like this:\nconda search --channel conda-forge rioxarray\nThe result will be a list of available versions and builds of this package in the conda-forge channel:\nLoading channels: done\n# Name                       Version           Build  Channel             \nrioxarray                      0.0.3            py_0  conda-forge         \nrioxarray                      0.0.4            py_0  conda-forge         \nrioxarray                      0.0.5            py_0  conda-forge     \n[...]\nrioxarray                     0.16.0    pyhd8ed1ab_0  conda-forge         \nrioxarray                     0.17.0    pyhd8ed1ab_0  conda-forge   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nDo you see any versions of rioxarray with multiple builds?\n\n\nSince we now know that we can find rioxarray in the conda-forge channel, we can go ahead and install it from this channel using the command\nconda install --channel conda-forge rioxarray\nYou‚Äôll see a moving bar that says Conda is solving (the) environment - this is Conda doing its package management job! It means Conda is working on:\n\nfinding the dependencies for the packages you are trying to install,\nfinding versions of these dependencies that are compatible with each other,\nmaking sure these new packages are compatible with the packages already present in the environment,\ndowngrade, upgrade, or remove packages as needed in the environment.\n\nOverall, Conda tries to install what we need with the least disruption. Solving an environment can often take time but it is crucial so that the environment remains stable and functional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\n\nCheck whether pandas is installed in the environment.\nWhich channels were used to install dependencies for rioxarray?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo deactivate our current environment and return to our base environment we simply run\nconda deactivate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nVerify we are no longer in the test-env. What environment are we on?\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this was a test environment, we can go ahead and delete all of it using the command:\nconda remove --name test-env  --all\nIt will ask you whether you want to proceed. Type y and press enter to go ahead and delete the environment.\nWe can run conda env list to verify the test-env does not exist anymore.\n\n\n\nWe can also create a new environment by specifying the package versions and channel priorities. For example, to install the numpy and rioxarray versions we previously had in a new environment called my-env we run:\nconda create --name my-env rioxarray=0.17.0 numpy=1.26.4 --channel conda-forge\nNotice we are explicitely requiring certain versions of our packages, and the --channel conda-forge option is asking Conda to prioritize getting the packages from conda-forge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nTake a look at the dependencies that were installed with these two packages.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the main goals of using an environment to manage the packages used in your project is being able to share the environment so that other people can rerun your code and reproduce your results.\n‚ÄúSharing the environment‚Äù means sharing instructions that Conda can use to recreate the environment you have. These instructions are, basically, a list of the packages installed in the environment, their versions, which channels were used to install them, and, optionally, build specifications.\nThere are several ways of creating these instructions to reconstruct an environment depending on the level of cross-platform compatibility we are looking for. However, each of the following methods to export the environment specifications will generate a new YAML file. This file type with .yml extension is human-readable markup language that is commonly used for configuration in software applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to project directory\n\n\n\nEach of the commands for exporting the environment specifications will create a .yml file in our terminal‚Äôs current working directory. Remember you can use pwd (Mac & Linux) or echo %cd% (Windows CMD) on the command line to check which is your current working directory. If you need to change directories you can use cd navigation in the terminal.\nThe best practice is to have the environment.yml file in the directory that holds your project. This way, you can use version control on it and push it to your remote repository.\n\n\n\n\nThe first method to export the environment specifications is running\nconda env export &gt; environment.yml\nThe environment.yml is the name of the YAML file that will have the environment specifications.\nOpen the environment.yml file that was generated, it will look similar to this excerpt:\nname: my-env\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - affine=2.4.0=pyhd8ed1ab_0\n  - attrs=24.2.0=pyh71513ae_0\n  [...]\n  - zlib=1.3.1=h87427d6_1\n  - zstd=1.5.6=h915ae27_0\nprefix: /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/my-env\nHere we can see the name of the environment, the channels used to install packages (in order of priority), and the package names, each with a version and build string. This ensures that the environment can be recreated exactly as it is on another system. This first method to export the environment specifications is the most detailed and it is both platform and package specific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete prefix line before sharing environment\n\n\n\nNotice the last line in the environment.yml file, this prefix indicates the absolute path to the environment‚Äôs installation on your local machine.\nYou should delete the prefix line when sharing the environment file. Leaving it there is unnecessary and could cause confusion since it points to specific directroy in your local machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur second method to export the environment specifications is to run\nconda env export --from-history &gt; environment_hist.yml\nHere I named the file environment_hist.yml to not overwrite the previous environmnet.yml, that way you can compare both of them. Open the environment_hist.yml file, it will look similar to this (much shorter than the previous one):\nname: my-env\nchannels:\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - numpy=1.26.4\n  - rioxarray=0.17.0\nprefix: /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/my-env\nAdding the --from-history option tells Conda to only include packages that we explicitely installed (in this case numpy=1.26.4 and rioxarray=0.17.0), omitting any dependencies that were automatically installed and channel information. This will create a minimal environment file that lists only the packages you explicitly installed, making it simpler and more portable for sharing with others. While this method ensures reproducibility of the core setup, Conda will resolve dependencies on its own and these might not be the same as your original environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding channels to environment.yml file\n\n\n\nIn section 5 we saw that the rioxarray package is available on the conda-forge channel, but not the defaults channel. The output of conda env export with the --from-history option only includes the defaults channel, so we wouldn‚Äôt be able to recreate the environment with that file as is. Remember the .yml file can be manually modified and we can edit it to include conda-forge as the first priority channel, followed by the defaults channel. Rememember to also delete the prefix line before sharing. The modified version of the --from-history output that will allow us to recreate the environment will be:\nname: my-env\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - numpy=1.26.4\n  - rioxarray=0.17.0\n\n\nBefore moving to the last exercise, delete the environment.yml and environment_hist.yml files.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this last exercise, click here and download the environment.yml file in this repository. Move to a directory for a mock project and navigate to that directory in the terminal.\n\nTo create an environment from specifications in a .yml file we run\nconda env create --name test-env --file environment.yml\nThen --name option states how we want to name our environment (test-env in this case). If no --name option is given, Conda will name of the environment using the name field in the environment.yml file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nVerify that the new environment was created, activate it, and take a look at the installed packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following table includes the commands covered in this lesson‚Äôs exercises. Check out Conda‚Äôs cheatsheet for more commands and tips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nWhat it does\n\n\n\n\nconda env list\nlist available Conda environments\n\n\nconda create --name ENVNAME python\ncreate a new Python environment named ENVNAME\n\n\nconda remove --name ENVNAME  --all\ndelete ENVNAME environment\n\n\nconda activate ENVNAME\nactivate environment\n\n\nconda deactivate\ndeactivate active environment\n\n\npython -V\nprint Python version installed in active environment\n\n\nconda list\nlist installed packages in active environment\n\n\nconda list PKGNAME\ncheck if PKGNAME package is installed in active environment\n\n\nconda install PKGNAME\ninstall PKGNAME package in environment using environment channel priorities (generally just from defaults channel)\n\n\nconda install --channel CHANNELNAME PKGNAME\ninstall PKGNAME package in environment from from CHANNELNAME channel\n\n\nconda search PKGNAME\nsearch for PKGNAME package in environment‚Äôs channels\n\n\nconda search --channel CHANNELNAME PKGNAME\nsearch for PKGNAME package in CHANNELNAME channel\n\n\nconda env export &gt; ENV.yml\nexport environment specifications of currently active environmemt into ENV.yml file (includes all dependencies, buildstrings, and channels)\n\n\nconda env export --from-history &gt; ENV.yml\nexport environment specifications of currently active environmemt into ENV.yml file (only packages explicitely installed, no dependencies, buildstrings, or channels)\n\n\nconda env create --name ENVNAME --file ENV.yml\ncreate an environment named ENVNAME from specifications in ENV.yml file",

Type y and press enter to create the environment and install the packages.\nIf we don‚Äôt include a Python version, the command conda create --name test-env python will install the most recent version of Python.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nCheck whether the new test-env environment is listed by Conda. Is it activated or not?\n\n\n\n\n\nTo activate the test-env environment we use the command\nconda activate test-env\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nVerify that test-env is now your current environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see which packages are installed within the currently active environment we run:\nconda list\nThe output will be a long list that looks something like this:\n# packages in environment at /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/test-env:\n#\n# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel\nbzip2                     1.0.8                h6c40b1e_6  \npip                       24.2            py312hecd8cb5_0  \nsqlite                    3.45.3               h6c40b1e_0  \n[...]\nThe name and version of each installed package in the environment appear in their respective columns. The ‚ÄòBuild‚Äô column shows a build string for each package. This string encodes important information about how the package was compiled, including any updates or changes made without altering the package version. It also reflects any compatibility or performance optimizations that were integrated during the build process.\nFor example, the same package with the same version might have different builds (and therefore different build strings) depending on whether it was installed on macOS, Windows, or Linux. This difference arises because the package may need to be compiled differently to optimize performance and ensure compatibility with each operating system.\nThe channel column shows the source from which the package was downloaded and installed. In this example the entries on this column are blank, signaling these packages were downloaded from the defeault Conda channel. We‚Äôll see other channels appear in the next examples.\nWe can also request information about a specific package. For example, if we run\nconda list pip\nwe obtain only the information about the pip package:\n# packages in environment at /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/test-env:\n#\n# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel\npip                       24.2            py312hecd8cb5_0  \nWe can use the same command to verify whether a package is installed. For example, if we run\nconda list numpy\nwe will get empty columns:\n# packages in environment at /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/test-env:\n#\n# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel\nbecause the numpy package is not intalled in this environment.\n\n\n\nSuppose we want to install numpy in our currently active environment test-env. To do this we can simply use the command:\nconda install numpy\nSince we have not specified another channel, this command will install numpy from the default channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nVerify that numpy is now installed.\n\n\nNow, suppose we want to install rioxarray, this is a Python package for raster data analysis. This is a relatively new package, so it might not be available from the default Conda channels. A sensible measure would be to first look if rioxarray is available in the defaults channels, which we can do by running:\nconda search rioxarray\nThe output will look similar to\nLoading channels: done\nNo match found for: rioxarray. Search: *rioxarray*\n\nPackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:\n\n  - rioxarray\n\nCurrent channels:\n\n  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/osx-64\n  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/noarch\n  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/osx-64\n  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/noarch\n\nTo search for alternate channels that may provide the Conda package you're\nlooking for, navigate to\n\n    https://anaconda.org\n\nand use the search bar at the top of the page.\nAs stated, rioxarray is not available on the default channels for my Conda installation. Notice a couple of the channels it is seraching on are specific to macOS (my current operating system). The last two channels are actually channels for R packages. If we had tried to install rioxarray using conda install rioxarray we would have obtained an error message with similar information (you can try it if you want!).\nWe may have better luck searching for rioxarray in the conda-forge channel, which we can do like this:\nconda search --channel conda-forge rioxarray\nThe result will be a list of available versions and builds of this package in the conda-forge channel:\nLoading channels: done\n# Name                       Version           Build  Channel             \nrioxarray                      0.0.3            py_0  conda-forge         \nrioxarray                      0.0.4            py_0  conda-forge         \nrioxarray                      0.0.5            py_0  conda-forge     \n[...]\nrioxarray                     0.16.0    pyhd8ed1ab_0  conda-forge         \nrioxarray                     0.17.0    pyhd8ed1ab_0  conda-forge   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nDo you see any versions of rioxarray with multiple builds?\n\n\nSince we now know that we can find rioxarray in the conda-forge channel, we can go ahead and install it from this channel using the command\nconda install --channel conda-forge rioxarray\nYou‚Äôll see a moving bar that says Conda is solving (the) environment - this is Conda doing its package management job! It means Conda is working on:\n\nfinding the dependencies for the packages you are trying to install,\nfinding versions of these dependencies that are compatible with each other,\nmaking sure these new packages are compatible with the packages already present in the environment,\ndowngrade, upgrade, or remove packages as needed in the environment.\n\nOverall, Conda tries to install what we need with the least disruption. Solving an environment can often take time but it is crucial so that the environment remains stable and functional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\n\nCheck whether pandas is installed in the environment.\nWhich channels were used to install dependencies for rioxarray?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo deactivate our current environment and return to our base environment we simply run\nconda deactivate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nVerify we are no longer in the test-env. What environment are we on?\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this was a test environment, we can go ahead and delete all of it using the command:\nconda remove --name test-env  --all\nIt will ask you whether you want to proceed. Type y and press enter to go ahead and delete the environment.\nWe can run conda env list to verify the test-env does not exist anymore.\n\n\n\nWe can also create a new environment by specifying the package versions and channel priorities. For example, to install the numpy and rioxarray versions we previously had in a new environment called my-env we run:\nconda create --name my-env rioxarray=0.17.0 numpy=1.26.4 --channel conda-forge\nNotice we are explicitely requiring certain versions of our packages, and the --channel conda-forge option is asking Conda to prioritize getting the packages from conda-forge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nTake a look at the dependencies that were installed with these two packages.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the main goals of using an environment to manage the packages used in your project is being able to share the environment so that other people can rerun your code and reproduce your results.\n‚ÄúSharing the environment‚Äù means sharing instructions that Conda can use to recreate the environment you have. These instructions are, basically, a list of the packages installed in the environment, their versions, which channels were used to install them, and, optionally, build specifications.\nThere are several ways of creating these instructions to reconstruct an environment depending on the level of cross-platform compatibility we are looking for. However, each of the following methods to export the environment specifications will generate a new YAML file. This file type with .yml extension is human-readable markup language that is commonly used for configuration in software applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to project directory\n\n\n\nEach of the commands for exporting the environment specifications will create a .yml file in our terminal‚Äôs current working directory. Remember you can use pwd (Mac & Linux) or echo %cd% (Windows CMD) on the command line to check which is your current working directory. If you need to change directories you can use cd navigation in the terminal.\nThe best practice is to have the environment.yml file in the directory that holds your project. This way, you can use version control on it and push it to your remote repository.\n\n\n\n\nThe first method to export the environment specifications is running\nconda env export &gt; environment.yml\nThe environment.yml is the name of the YAML file that will have the environment specifications.\nOpen the environment.yml file that was generated, it will look similar to this excerpt:\nname: my-env\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - affine=2.4.0=pyhd8ed1ab_0\n  - attrs=24.2.0=pyh71513ae_0\n  [...]\n  - zlib=1.3.1=h87427d6_1\n  - zstd=1.5.6=h915ae27_0\nprefix: /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/my-env\nHere we can see the name of the environment, the channels used to install packages (in order of priority), and the package names, each with a version and build string. This ensures that the environment can be recreated exactly as it is on another system. This first method to export the environment specifications is the most detailed and it is both platform and package specific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete prefix line before sharing environment\n\n\n\nNotice the last line in the environment.yml file, this prefix indicates the absolute path to the environment‚Äôs installation on your local machine.\nYou should delete the prefix line when sharing the environment file. Leaving it there is unnecessary and could cause confusion since it points to specific directroy in your local machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur second method to export the environment specifications is to run\nconda env export --from-history &gt; environment_hist.yml\nHere I named the file environment_hist.yml to not overwrite the previous environmnet.yml, that way you can compare both of them. Open the environment_hist.yml file, it will look similar to this (much shorter than the previous one):\nname: my-env\nchannels:\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - numpy=1.26.4\n  - rioxarray=0.17.0\nprefix: /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/my-env\nAdding the --from-history option tells Conda to only include packages that we explicitely installed (in this case numpy=1.26.4 and rioxarray=0.17.0), omitting any dependencies that were automatically installed and channel information. This will create a minimal environment file that lists only the packages you explicitly installed, making it simpler and more portable for sharing with others. While this method ensures reproducibility of the core setup, Conda will resolve dependencies on its own and these might not be the same as your original environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding channels to environment.yml file\n\n\n\nIn section 5 we saw that the rioxarray package is available on the conda-forge channel, but not the defaults channel. The output of conda env export with the --from-history option only includes the defaults channel, so we wouldn‚Äôt be able to recreate the environment with that file as is. Remember the .yml file can be manually modified and we can edit it to include conda-forge as the first priority channel, followed by the defaults channel. Rememember to also delete the prefix line before sharing. The modified version of the --from-history output that will allow us to recreate the environment will be:\nname: my-env\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - numpy=1.26.4\n  - rioxarray=0.17.0\n\n\nBefore moving to the last exercise, delete the environment.yml and environment_hist.yml files.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this last exercise, click here and download the environment.yml file in this repository. Move to a directory for a mock project and navigate to that directory in the terminal.\n\nTo create an environment from specifications in a .yml file we run\nconda env create --name test-env --file environment.yml\nThen --name option states how we want to name our environment (test-env in this case). If no --name option is given, Conda will name of the environment using the name field in the environment.yml file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nVerify that the new environment was created, activate it, and take a look at the installed packages.",

    "text": "In this section we review what is a coordinate reference system (CRS). The materials here are meant to act as a refresher of the lesson on coordinate reference systems in week 2 of the EDS 223 - Geospatial Analysis & Remote Sensing MEDS course.\n\n\n\nSince the Earth does not have lines and numbers etched on it, us humans need to create a system to locate places on its surface. A way to solve this is to create a coordinate reference system (CRS). A CRS is, at its core, a way to represent places on the Earth as coordinates.\nTo understand what are the components of a CRS it can be useful to think of the process we would undergo to match places on the Earth to coordinates that represent them.\n\n\nThink of the Earth. Our planet is not a perfect sphere. Besides its rugged surface with high mountains and deep ocean trenches, the shape of the Earth is not round. Due to the Earth‚Äôs rotation, the planet is slightly wider at the Equator. Thus, a sphere is not the best way to model the shape of the Earth. Instead, we use an ellipsoid. Think of an ellipsoid as a sphere that has been flattened a bit, thus making it wider across one axis. This is the first step for creating a CRS: picking an ellipsoid, a.k.a picking a shape for the Earth. The ellipsoid used to represent the Earth‚Äôs shape has changed across time and it may also change depending on the application.\n\n\n\n\nThe ellipsoid is an abstract mathematical object on which we can locate points on it by using angles. The coordinate system on the ellipsoid is (angles from \\(x\\), angles from \\(y\\)).\n\n\n\nLatitude and longtide as angular coordinates on the ellipsoid. Image source: Coordinate systems and map projections - University of Twente\n\n\nThe next step to create a CRS is thus to make a decision on how to align the ellipsoid so that it‚Äôs surface corresponds to actual places on the Earth. We could think, for example, of:\n\nhow to place the ellipsoid‚Äôs center relative to Earth‚Äôs mass center (is it the same or is it off?) or\nhow to align the ellipsoid‚Äôs axes with the Earth (which meridian will be our prime meridian?).\n\nGenerally speaking, a geodetic datum, or just a datum, is how we are aligning our abstract ellipsoid to match the Earth‚Äôs surface.\n\n\n\nRegional datums to optimize location accuracy. Image source: GPS for Land Surveyors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatums may change across time and applications\n\n\n\nGeographers and cartographers have created and used many datums across time and applications. Sometimes datum refers both to a choice of ellipsoid and how to align it to the Earth. More importantly, different datums are used to increase the accuracy of representing different regions of Earth. At the GIS wiki you can see a list of names of different datums optimized for different regions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, we have successfully made a correspondence between the Earth‚Äôs surface of and our ellipsoid. This means we can now use the latitude,longitude (lat/lon) coordinates of the ellipsoid to locate any point on the Earth‚Äôs surface. This is called a geographic CRS. Geographic coordinate reference systems use degrees of latitude and longitude to locate points on the Earth, still thinking of it as a 3D object.\n\n\n\nWe use a geographic CRS to create angular coordiantes on the Earth (latitude and longitude) that allow us to locate any place\n\n\n\n\n\nA map is a flat (2-dimensional) representation of a region of the Earth. In a geographic CRS we use a 3-dimensional model of the Earth (the ellipsoid) to locate places on it. To transform our 3-dimensional ellipsoid to make a 2-dimensional representation we need to use a projection. A projection is a method to convert between angular coordinates (i.e.¬†lat/lon coordinates in 3D) and planar coordinates (i.e.¬†\\(x\\),\\(y\\) coordinates in 2D).\n\n\n\nImage Source: Battersby, S. (2017). Map Projections. The Geographic Information Science & Technology Body of Knowledge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany projections\n\n\n\nThere are many ways to project an ellipsoid into a 2-dimensional region. However, no matter what projection we use, the area, distances, or angles of the actual regions on Earth will be distorted when we project. Ultimately, the choice of projection relies on whether we want to optimze calculations involving area, angle, or distance measurements, as well as aesthetics when creating a map.\n\n\nThe following video, Vox - Why all world maps are wrong, does a great job at how projections work!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we project a region of the ellipsoid to represent a region of Earth on the plane we obtain a new set of planar coordinates, thus creating a projected CRS. A projected CRS must also include a unit of measure for its axes.

Surveys have happened yearly from 2010 to 2023.\n\n\n\nLet us start by loading the data:\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in file\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/wetlands_seasonal_bird_diversity.csv')\n\n# Check the first 5 rows\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nCSM_winter\nCSM_spring\nCSM_fall\nMUL_winter\nMUL_spring\nMUL_fall\nSDW_winter\nSDW_spring\nSDW_fall\nTJE_winter\nTJE_spring\nTJE_fall\n\n\n\n\n0\n2010\n39.0\n40.0\n50.0\n45.0\nNaN\n61.0\nNaN\n75.0\n85.0\nNaN\nNaN\n81.0\n\n\n1\n2011\n48.0\n44.0\nNaN\n58.0\n52.0\nNaN\n78.0\n74.0\nNaN\n67.0\n70.0\nNaN\n\n\n2\n2012\n51.0\n43.0\n49.0\n57.0\n58.0\n53.0\n71.0\n72.0\n73.0\n70.0\n63.0\n69.0\n\n\n3\n2013\n42.0\n46.0\n38.0\n60.0\n58.0\n62.0\n69.0\n70.0\n70.0\n69.0\n74.0\n64.0\n\n\n4\n2014\n38.0\n43.0\n45.0\n49.0\n52.0\n57.0\n61.0\n78.0\n71.0\n60.0\n81.0\n62.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pandas.DataFrame has a built-in method plot() for plotting. When we call it without specifying any other parameters plot() creates one line plot for each of the columns with numeric data.\n\n# Default plot(): one line plot per column with numeric data\ndf.plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, this doesn‚Äôt make much sense! In particular, look at the x-axis. The default for plot is to use the values of the index as the x-axis values. Let‚Äôs see some examples about how to improve this situation.\n\n\n\nWe can make a line plot of one column against another by using the following the general syntax:\ndf.plot(x='x_values_column', y='y_values_column')\n\n\nIf we want to plot the bird surveys at Carpinteria Salt Marsh across years we can do:\n\n# Birds species registered during winter at CSM yearly\ndf.plot(x='year', y='CSM_winter')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can do some basic customization specifying other parameters of the plot() method. Some basic ones are:\n\ntitle: title to use for the plot.\nxlabel: name to use for the x-label on x-axis\nylabel: bame to use for the y-label on y-axis\ncolor: change the color of our plot\nlegend: boolean value True or False. True (default) includes the legend, False removes the legend\n\nIn action:\n\ndf.plot(x='year', \n        y='CSM_winter',\n        title='Bird species registered during winter at Carpinteria Salt Marsh',\n        xlabel='Year',\n        ylabel='Number of bird species',\n        color='green',\n        legend=False\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see all the optional parameters for the plot() function in the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\n\nPlot a graph of the spring bird surveys at Mugu Lagoon with respect to the years. Include some basic customization.\nUse the isna() method for pandas.Series and row selection to select the rows in which Mugu Lagoon has NAs during the spring survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot multiple line plots by updating these parameters in the plot() method:\n\ny : a list of column names that will be plotted against the x-axis\ncolor: a dictionary {'column_1' : 'color_1', 'column_2':'color_2} specifying the color of each column‚Äôs line plot\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs say we want to compare the bird surveys at the Tijuana Estuary during spring and fall across years.\n\ndf.plot(x='year', \n        y=['TJE_spring', 'TJE_fall'],\n        title = 'Seasonal bird surveys at Tijuana Estuary',\n        xlabel='Year',\n        ylabel='Number of bird species',        \n        color = {'TJE_spring':'#F48FB1',\n                 'TJE_fall': '#AB47BC'\n                 }\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that for specifying the colors we used a HEX code, this gives us more control over how our graph looks.\nWe can also create separate plots for each column by setting the subset to True.\n\ndf.plot(x='year', \n        y=['TJE_spring', 'TJE_fall'],\n        title = 'Seasonal bird surveys at Tijuana Estuary',\n        xlabel='Year',\n        ylabel='Number of bird species',        \n        color = {'TJE_spring':'#F48FB1',\n                 'TJE_fall': '#AB47BC'\n                 },\n        subplots=True\n        )\n\narray([&lt;Axes: xlabel='Year', ylabel='Number of bird species'&gt;,\n       &lt;Axes: xlabel='Year', ylabel='Number of bird species'&gt;],\n      dtype=object)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating the index of our data frame to be something other than the default integers numbering the rows can be a useful operation for plotting. To update the index we use the set_index() method for a pandas.DataFrame. It‚Äôs general syntax is:\ndf = df.set_index(new_index)\nwhere new_index is:\n\nthe name of the column in the data frame df we want to use as new index\nif our new index is not a column in the data frame, an array or pandas.Series of the same length as our data frame (we need one index per row).\n\nThis operation does not happen in-place.\n\nA funciton acting in-place means that our original object (in this case a pandas.DataFrame) is modified.\nIf the function does not act in-place, a new object (in this case a pandas.DataFrame) is created and the original is not modified.\n\nIf we wanted to update our df data frame we could do an explicit assignment to reassign the output of set_index() to df:\n# Set `column_name` column in df as the new index (reassignment)\ndf = df.set_index('column_name')\nor use the optional inplace parameter:\n# Set `column_name` column in df as the new index (modify df in-place)\ndf.set_index('column_name', inplace=True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, avoid using the inplace=True argument and favor explicit variable assignments\n\n\n\nCheck the information about the inplace parameter in the set_index() documentation. You will often see the inplace parameter in methods for pandas.DataFrames. The best practice is to avoid inplace=True for better readability and maintainable code. Explicitly assigning the result to a new variable or the same variable makes it clear that an operation has occurred.\n\n\n\n\nIn all our previous examples we used the year column as the x-axis. Since all our bird survey variables are dependent on the year, it makes sense to use the year column as the index of the data frame:\n\n# Update index to be the year column\ndf = df.set_index('year')\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSM_winter\nCSM_spring\nCSM_fall\nMUL_winter\nMUL_spring\nMUL_fall\nSDW_winter\nSDW_spring\nSDW_fall\nTJE_winter\nTJE_spring\nTJE_fall\n\n\nyear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2010\n39.0\n40.0\n50.0\n45.0\nNaN\n61.0\nNaN\n75.0\n85.0\nNaN\nNaN\n81.0\n\n\n2011\n48.0\n44.0\nNaN\n58.0\n52.0\nNaN\n78.0\n74.0\nNaN\n67.0\n70.0\nNaN\n\n\n2012\n51.0\n43.0\n49.0\n57.0\n58.0\n53.0\n71.0\n72.0\n73.0\n70.0\n63.0\n69.0\n\n\n2013\n42.0\n46.0\n38.0\n60.0\n58.0\n62.0\n69.0\n70.0\n70.0\n69.0\n74.0\n64.0\n\n\n2014\n38.0\n43.0\n45.0\n49.0\n52.0\n57.0\n61.0\n78.0\n71.0\n60.0\n81.0\n62.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Simple plot of Carpinteria Salt Marsh winter surveys\ndf.plot(y='CSM_winter')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf needed, we can reset the index to be the numbering of the rows:\n\ndf = df.reset_index()\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nCSM_winter\nCSM_spring\nCSM_fall\nMUL_winter\nMUL_spring\nMUL_fall\nSDW_winter\nSDW_spring\nSDW_fall\nTJE_winter\nTJE_spring\nTJE_fall\n\n\n\n\n0\n2010\n39.0\n40.0\n50.0\n45.0\nNaN\n61.0\nNaN\n75.0\n85.0\nNaN\nNaN\n81.0\n\n\n1\n2011\n48.0\n44.0\nNaN\n58.0\n52.0\nNaN\n78.0\n74.0\nNaN\n67.0\n70.0\nNaN\n\n\n2\n2012\n51.0\n43.0\n49.0\n57.0\n58.0\n53.0\n71.0\n72.0\n73.0\n70.0\n63.0\n69.0\n\n\n3\n2013\n42.0\n46.0\n38.0\n60.0\n58.0\n62.0\n69.0\n70.0\n70.0\n69.0\n74.0\n64.0\n\n\n4\n2014\n38.0\n43.0\n45.0\n49.0\n52.0\n57.0\n61.0\n78.0\n71.0\n60.0\n81.0\n62.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\n\nWithout running the code, give a step-by-step breakdown of what this code is doing:\n\ndf.set_index('year').loc[:,'SDW_winter':'TJE_fall'].plot()\n\nIs this code modifying the data frame df? Why or why not?\nRun the code and examine the graph. Review the data description. Do we have all the necessary information to make sure it makes sense to directly compare the surveys at these different sites? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code used in the check-in\ndf.set_index('year').loc[:,'SDW_winter':'TJE_fall'].plot()\nis an example of method chaining. Each method in the chain returns an object (typically the same object), allowing the next method to be called directly on the result. This is a powerful technique that makes code concise and readable.\nChaining methods can result in lines of code that are too long and hard to read. We can break up chains of methods by using parenthesis:\n(df.set_index('year')\n  .loc[:,'SDW_winter':'TJE_fall']\n  .plot()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod chaining and the R pipe operator\n\n\n\nIf you are familiar with R, you may have noticed that the period . in the method chianing acts in the same way as the R pipe operator (%&gt;% or |&gt;). The syntax of one method per line is similar to what is used in the tidyverse, except that the pipe is used at the end of the line, while the period is used at the beginning of the line.\n\n\nAn alternative to the previous code chaining could have been:\nyear_index_df = df.set_index('year')\nsubset_df = year_index_df.loc[:,'SDW_winter':'TJE_fall']\nsubset_df.plot()\nWhile this accomplishes the same output, several variables are created along the way and it can be difficult to keep track of what is what.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse method chaining wisely\n\n\n\nMethod chaining is particularly useful in pandas for streamlining multiple data manipulations. However:\n\nmethod chaining should be used with care to avoid overly complex and difficult-to-debug code, and\nif you‚Äôre not familiar with the methods, it‚Äôs better to apply them individually and review the results after each step.\n\n\n\nWe will move on to another dataset for the rest of this lesson.\n\n\n\nFor the next plots we will use the Palmer Penguins dataset [2] developed by Drs. Allison Horst, Alison Hill and Kristen Gorman. This dataset contains size measurements for three penguin species in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica during 2007, 2008, and 2009.\n\n\n\nThe Palmer Archipelago penguins.

The parameter that controls this behaviour is the kind parameter. By changing the value of kind we can create different kinds of plots. Let‚Äôs look at the documentation to see what these values are:\n\n\n\nExtract from the pandas.DataFrame.plot documentation. Accessed on Sept 25,2024\n\n\nNotice the default value of kind is 'line'.\nLet‚Äôs change the kind parameter to create some different plots.\n\n\n\nSuppose we want to visualy compare the flipper length against the body mass, we can do this with a scatterplot:\n\npenguins.plot(kind='scatter',\n              x='flipper_length_mm', \n              y='body_mass_g')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can update some other arguments to customize the graph:\n\npenguins.plot(kind='scatter',\n              x='flipper_length_mm', \n              y='body_mass_g',\n              title='Flipper length and body mass for Palmer penguins',\n              xlabel='Flipper length (mm)',\n              ylabel='Body mass (g)',\n              color='#ff3b01',\n              alpha=0.4  # Controls transparency\n              )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can create bar plots of our data setting kind='bar' in the plot() method.\nFor example, let‚Äôs say we want to get data about the 10 penguins with lowest body mass. We can first select this data using the nsmallest() method for series:\n\nsmallest = penguins['body_mass_g'].nsmallest(10)\nsmallest\n\n314    2700.0\n58     2850.0\n64     2850.0\n54     2900.0\n98     2900.0\n116    2900.0\n298    2900.0\n104    2925.0\n47     2975.0\n44     3000.0\nName: body_mass_g, dtype: float64\n\n\nWe can then plot this data as a bar plot\n\nsmallest.plot(kind='bar')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we wanted to look at other data for these smallest penguins we can use a different call to the nsmallest method:\n\npenguins.nsmallest(10, 'body_mass_g')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nisland\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nflipper_length_mm\nbody_mass_g\nsex\nyear\n\n\n\n\n314\nChinstrap\nDream\n46.9\n16.6\n192.0\n2700.0\nfemale\n2008\n\n\n58\nAdelie\nBiscoe\n36.5\n16.6\n181.0\n2850.0\nfemale\n2008\n\n\n64\nAdelie\nBiscoe\n36.4\n17.1\n184.0\n2850.0\nfemale\n2008\n\n\n54\nAdelie\nBiscoe\n34.5\n18.1\n187.0\n2900.0\nfemale\n2008\n\n\n98\nAdelie\nDream\n33.1\n16.1\n178.0\n2900.0\nfemale\n2008\n\n\n116\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n38.6\n17.0\n188.0\n2900.0\nfemale\n2009\n\n\n298\nChinstrap\nDream\n43.2\n16.6\n187.0\n2900.0\nfemale\n2007\n\n\n104\nAdelie\nBiscoe\n37.9\n18.6\n193.0\n2925.0\nfemale\n2009\n\n\n47\nAdelie\nDream\n37.5\n18.9\n179.0\n2975.0\nNaN\n2007\n\n\n44\nAdelie\nDream\n37.0\n16.9\n185.0\n3000.0\nfemale\n2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can create a histogram of our data setting kind='hist' in plot().\n\n# Using plot without subsetting data - a mess again\npenguins.plot(kind='hist')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo gain actual information, let‚Äôs subset the data before plotting it. For example, suppose we want to do a preliminary graph for the distribution of flipper length. We could do it in this way:\n\n# Distribution of flipper length measurements\n# First select data, then plot\npenguins['flipper_length_mm'].plot(kind='hist',\n                                title='Penguin flipper lengths',\n                                xlabel='Flipper length (mm)',\n                                grid=True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\n\nSelect the bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm columns in the penguins dataframe and then update the kind parameter to box to make boxplots of the bill length and bill depth. \nCreate a simple histogram of the flipper length of female gentoo penguins.",

This dataset was derived for education purposes for this course from the UCSB SONGS Mitigation Monitoring: Wetland Performance Standard - Bird Abundance and Species Richness dataset [1]. The SONGS dataset was collected as part of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) San Dieguito Wetland Restoration monitoring program.\nThe annual bird species abundance estimates is a CSV file with 13 columns and 14 rows.

The values from the second column to the last column correspond to the number of different bird species recorded across the survey sites in each wetland during winter, spring, and fall of a given year. For example, the CSM_fall column has the number of species recorded in fall at Carpinteria Salt Marsh across years. The year column corresponds to the calendar year on which the data was collected. Surveys have happened yearly from 2010 to 2023.",

    "text": "Updating the index of our data frame to be something other than the default integers numbering the rows can be a useful operation for plotting. To update the index we use the set_index() method for a pandas.DataFrame. It‚Äôs general syntax is:\ndf = df.set_index(new_index)\nwhere new_index is:\n\nthe name of the column in the data frame df we want to use as new index\nif our new index is not a column in the data frame, an array or pandas.Series of the same length as our data frame (we need one index per row).\n\nThis operation does not happen in-place.\n\nA funciton acting in-place means that our original object (in this case a pandas.DataFrame) is modified.\nIf the function does not act in-place, a new object (in this case a pandas.DataFrame) is created and the original is not modified.\n\nIf we wanted to update our df data frame we could do an explicit assignment to reassign the output of set_index() to df:\n# Set `column_name` column in df as the new index (reassignment)\ndf = df.set_index('column_name')\nor use the optional inplace parameter:\n# Set `column_name` column in df as the new index (modify df in-place)\ndf.set_index('column_name', inplace=True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, avoid using the inplace=True argument and favor explicit variable assignments\n\n\n\nCheck the information about the inplace parameter in the set_index() documentation. You will often see the inplace parameter in methods for pandas.DataFrames. The best practice is to avoid inplace=True for better readability and maintainable code. Explicitly assigning the result to a new variable or the same variable makes it clear that an operation has occurred.\n\n\n\n\nIn all our previous examples we used the year column as the x-axis.

    "text": "The code used in the check-in\ndf.set_index('year').loc[:,'SDW_winter':'TJE_fall'].plot()\nis an example of method chaining. Each method in the chain returns an object (typically the same object), allowing the next method to be called directly on the result. This is a powerful technique that makes code concise and readable.\nChaining methods can result in lines of code that are too long and hard to read. We can break up chains of methods by using parenthesis:\n(df.set_index('year')\n  .loc[:,'SDW_winter':'TJE_fall']\n  .plot()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod chaining and the R pipe operator\n\n\n\nIf you are familiar with R, you may have noticed that the period . in the method chianing acts in the same way as the R pipe operator (%&gt;% or |&gt;). The syntax of one method per line is similar to what is used in the tidyverse, except that the pipe is used at the end of the line, while the period is used at the beginning of the line.\n\n\nAn alternative to the previous code chaining could have been:\nyear_index_df = df.set_index('year')\nsubset_df = year_index_df.loc[:,'SDW_winter':'TJE_fall']\nsubset_df.plot()\nWhile this accomplishes the same output, several variables are created along the way and it can be difficult to keep track of what is what.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse method chaining wisely\n\n\n\nMethod chaining is particularly useful in pandas for streamlining multiple data manipulations. However:\n\nmethod chaining should be used with care to avoid overly complex and difficult-to-debug code, and\nif you‚Äôre not familiar with the methods, it‚Äôs better to apply them individually and review the results after each step.\n\n\n\nWe will move on to another dataset for the rest of this lesson.",

This dataset contains size measurements for three penguin species in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica during 2007, 2008, and 2009.\n\n\n\nThe Palmer Archipelago penguins.

This syntax for adding a new column to a pandas.DataFrame is the same as adding a new key-value pair to a dictionary:\n# Add a new key-value pair to a dictionary\ndict[new_key] = new_value\n\n\nWe want to create a new column where the body mass is in kilograms instead of grams, then we need to divide each value in the body_mass_g by 1000.\n\n# Add new column body_mass_kg \npenguins['body_mass_kg'] = penguins['body_mass_g']/1000\n\n# Confirm the new column is in the data frame\nprint(\"body_mass_kg is in the data frame's columns: \", 'body_mass_kg' in penguins.columns)\n\n# Look at the new column\npenguins.head()\n\nbody_mass_kg is in the data frame's columns:  True\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nisland\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nflipper_length_mm\nbody_mass_g\nsex\nyear\nbody_mass_kg\n\n\n\n\n0\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n39.1\n18.7\n181.0\n3750.0\nmale\n2007\n3.75\n\n\n1\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n39.5\n17.4\n186.0\n3800.0\nfemale\n2007\n3.80\n\n\n2\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n40.3\n18.0\n195.0\n3250.0\nfemale\n2007\n3.25\n\n\n3\nAdelie\nTorgersen\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n2007\nNaN\n\n\n4\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n36.7\n19.3\n193.0\n3450.0\nfemale\n2007\n3.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also create or update an existing column using the assign() method for pandas.DataFrames. The general syntax is:\ndf = df.assign(new_col_name=new_column_values)\nNotice the new column names are not strings, we declare them as if we were creating variables.\nThis way of creating a new column, unlike the dictionary-like syntax, does not modify the data frame in-place. This can be useful for chaining operations:\n\n(penguins.assign(bill_length_cm=penguins.bill_length_mm/10)\n        .plot(kind='scatter',\n              x='bill_length_cm', \n              y='body_mass_g')\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new column was added by default at the end of the data frame. If we want to create a new column and insert it at a particular position we can use the data frame method insert():\ndf.insert(loc=integer_index,  # Location of new column\n          column='new_col_name', \n          value=new_col_values)\n\n\nLet‚Äôs give each penguin observation a unique identifier as a three digit number and add this column at the beginning of the data frame.\n\n# Create random 3-digit codes\ncodes = random.sample(range(100,1000), len(penguins))  # Sampling w/o replacement\n\n# Insert codes at the front of data frame\npenguins.insert(loc=0,  # Index\n                column='id_code',\n                value=codes)\n        \npenguins.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_code\nspecies\nisland\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nflipper_length_mm\nbody_mass_g\nsex\nyear\nbody_mass_kg\n\n\n\n\n0\n754\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n39.1\n18.7\n181.0\n3750.0\nmale\n2007\n3.75\n\n\n1\n214\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n39.5\n17.4\n186.0\n3800.0\nfemale\n2007\n3.80\n\n\n2\n125\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n40.3\n18.0\n195.0\n3250.0\nfemale\n2007\n3.25\n\n\n3\n859\nAdelie\nTorgersen\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n2007\nNaN\n\n\n4\n381\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n36.7\n19.3\n193.0\n3450.0\nfemale\n2007\n3.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also use the assign() method to create or update multiple columns in the same call.

Notice again that the drop() method does not modify the data frame in place, so you need to reassign the output.\n\n\nNow that we updated the units for flipper length and body mass, it makes sense to remove the previous columns to avoid duplicate information. We can do this using drop():\n\n# Remove duplicate length and mass measurements\npenguins = penguins.drop(columns=['flipper_length_mm','body_mass_g'])\n\n# Confirm result\nprint(penguins.columns)\n\nIndex(['id_code', 'species', 'island', 'bill_length_mm', 'bill_depth_mm',\n       'sex', 'year', 'body_mass_kg', 'flipper_length_cm', 'observer'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we want to update a specific value in our data frame. We‚Äôll review some methods and best practices to do that in this section.\n\n\nWe can access a single value in a pandas.DataFrame using the locators\n\nat[] to select by labels, or\niat[] to select by position.\n\nThe syntax for at[] is:\ndf.at[single_index_value, 'column_name']\nThink of at[] as the equivalent to loc[] when trying to access a single value.\n\n\nFor this example, let‚Äôs first update the index of the data frame to be the id_code column:\n\npenguins = penguins.set_index('id_code')\npenguins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nisland\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nsex\nyear\nbody_mass_kg\nflipper_length_cm\nobserver\n\n\nid_code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n754\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n39.1\n18.7\nmale\n2007\n3.750\n18.1\nC\n\n\n214\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n39.5\n17.4\nfemale\n2007\n3.800\n18.6\nA\n\n\n125\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n40.3\n18.0\nfemale\n2007\n3.250\n19.5\nC\n\n\n859\nAdelie\nTorgersen\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n2007\nNaN\nNaN\nA\n\n\n381\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n36.7\n19.3\nfemale\n2007\n3.450\n19.3\nB\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n140\nChinstrap\nDream\n55.8\n19.8\nmale\n2009\n4.000\n20.7\nC\n\n\n183\nChinstrap\nDream\n43.5\n18.1\nfemale\n2009\n3.400\n20.2\nA\n\n\n969\nChinstrap\nDream\n49.6\n18.2\nmale\n2009\n3.775\n19.3\nC\n\n\n635\nChinstrap\nDream\n50.8\n19.0\nmale\n2009\n4.100\n21.0\nA\n\n\n883\nChinstrap\nDream\n50.2\n18.7\nfemale\n2009\n3.775\n19.8\nB\n\n\n\n\n344 rows √ó 9 columns\n\n\n\nIf we want to know what was the bill length of the penguin which has ID number 859, we can directly access that information using at[]:\n\n# Check bill length of penguin with ID 859\npenguins.at[859, 'bill_length_mm']\n\nnan\n\n\nWe get this bill length is an NA.

The syntax for iat[] is:\ndf.iat[index_integer_location, column_integer_location]\nThis is the same way you would index entries in a matrix. You may find it useful to think of iat[] as the equivalent of iloc[] to access a single value in the data frame.\nObtaining the location of a specific column within the column list can be prone to error if we do it ‚Äòby hand‚Äô.

The general syntax for updating data with loc is:\ndf.loc[row_selection, column_name] = new_values\nwhere\n\nrow_selection is the rows we want to update, this can be any expression that gives us a boolean pandas.Series,\ncol_name is a single column name, and\nnew_values is the new value or values we want.

In this case, the bug is that we actually did not update our data frame:\n\n# Confirm values were updated\nprint(penguins['sex'].unique())\n\n['M' 'female' nan]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid chained indexing [][] and use .loc[]\n\n\n\nThe SettingWithCopyWarning often arises from chained indexing:\ndf[df['col'] == value]['col2'] = new_value\nIn the words of the pandas documentation:\n\nassigning to the product of chained indexing has inherently unpredictable results.\n\nThe best practice is to use .loc[] instead:\ndf.loc[df['col'] == value,'col2'] = new_value\n.loc[] is generally more readable and explicitly modifies the original data frame.\nWarnings in Python are intended to be helpful and can prevent unintended data modification errors!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nUpdate the ‚Äúfemale‚Äù values in the penguins data frame to ‚ÄúF‚Äù. Don‚Äôt use chained indexing. Confirm that the values in the column were updated.\n\n\n\nTo understand why the SettingWithCopyWarning pops up we need to understand that some pandas operations return a view to your data, while others return a copy of your data.\n\nViews are actual subsets of the original data, when we update them, we are modifying the original data frame.\nCopies are unique objects, independent of our original data frames. When we update a copy we are not modifying the original data frame.\n\n\n\nDepending on what we are trying to do we might want to modify the original data frame or we might want to modify a copy.\n\nPandas raises the SettingWithCopyWarning because it tries to balance memory efficiency with data integrity. By default, it avoids creating unnecessary copies, but sometimes it‚Äôs ambiguous whether a subset should be independent (a copy) or connected (a view).\n\n\nWe only want to use data from Biscoe island and, after doing some analyses, we want to add a new column to it:\n\n# Select penguins from Biscoe island\nbiscoe = penguins[penguins.island=='Biscoe']\n\n# ... Other analyses ...\n\n# Add a column\nbiscoe['sample_col'] = 100  # This raises SettingWithCopyWarning\n\n/var/folders/gm/chd1kps96_g7xdxyfw150wm80000gp/T/ipykernel_7781/844154415.py:7: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.\nTry using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  biscoe['sample_col'] = 100  # This raises SettingWithCopyWarning\n\n\npandas is trying to alert you that it is unsure about whether biscoe is a view or a copy and it‚Äôs unclear whether an of our code will modify our dataset or not.\nTo fix this we can take control of the copy-view situation and explicitly ask for a copy of the dataset when subsetting the data. Use the copy() method to do this:\n\n# Make sure you get an independent data frame that won't alter the original\nbiscoe = penguins[penguins.island=='Biscoe'].copy()\n\n# Add a column, no warning\nbiscoe['sample_col'] = 100\n\nNow we are sure we did not modify our initial data, but rather the biscoe data frame:\n\n# Confirm the new column is in our subset data\nbiscoe.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nisland\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nsex\nyear\nbody_mass_kg\nflipper_length_cm\nobserver\nsize\nsample_col\n\n\nid_code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338\nAdelie\nBiscoe\n37.8\n18.3\nF\n2007\n3.40\n17.4\nA\nmedium\n100\n\n\n617\nAdelie\nBiscoe\n37.7\n18.7\nM\n2007\n3.60\n18.0\nC\nmedium\n100\n\n\n716\nAdelie\nBiscoe\n35.9\n19.2\nF\n2007\n3.80\n18.9\nC\nmedium\n100\n\n\n127\nAdelie\nBiscoe\n38.2\n18.1\nM\n2007\n3.95\n18.5\nB\nmedium\n100\n\n\n674\nAdelie\nBiscoe\n38.8\n17.2\nM\n2007\n3.80\n18.0\nC\nmedium\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Confirm that original data was not modified\nprint('sample_column' in penguins.columns)\n\nFalse\n\n\nThe SettingWithCopyWarning can be tricky, there are also false positives and false negatives.

This syntax for adding a new column to a pandas.DataFrame is the same as adding a new key-value pair to a dictionary:\n# Add a new key-value pair to a dictionary\ndict[new_key] = new_value\n\n\nWe want to create a new column where the body mass is in kilograms instead of grams, then we need to divide each value in the body_mass_g by 1000.\n\n# Add new column body_mass_kg \npenguins['body_mass_kg'] = penguins['body_mass_g']/1000\n\n# Confirm the new column is in the data frame\nprint(\"body_mass_kg is in the data frame's columns: \", 'body_mass_kg' in penguins.columns)\n\n# Look at the new column\npenguins.head()\n\nbody_mass_kg is in the data frame's columns:  True\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nisland\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nflipper_length_mm\nbody_mass_g\nsex\nyear\nbody_mass_kg\n\n\n\n\n0\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n39.1\n18.7\n181.0\n3750.0\nmale\n2007\n3.75\n\n\n1\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n39.5\n17.4\n186.0\n3800.0\nfemale\n2007\n3.80\n\n\n2\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n40.3\n18.0\n195.0\n3250.0\nfemale\n2007\n3.25\n\n\n3\nAdelie\nTorgersen\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n2007\nNaN\n\n\n4\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n36.7\n19.3\n193.0\n3450.0\nfemale\n2007\n3.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also create or update an existing column using the assign() method for pandas.DataFrames. The general syntax is:\ndf = df.assign(new_col_name=new_column_values)\nNotice the new column names are not strings, we declare them as if we were creating variables.\nThis way of creating a new column, unlike the dictionary-like syntax, does not modify the data frame in-place. This can be useful for chaining operations:\n\n(penguins.assign(bill_length_cm=penguins.bill_length_mm/10)\n        .plot(kind='scatter',\n              x='bill_length_cm', \n              y='body_mass_g')\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new column was added by default at the end of the data frame. If we want to create a new column and insert it at a particular position we can use the data frame method insert():\ndf.insert(loc=integer_index,  # Location of new column\n          column='new_col_name', \n          value=new_col_values)\n\n\nLet‚Äôs give each penguin observation a unique identifier as a three digit number and add this column at the beginning of the data frame.\n\n# Create random 3-digit codes\ncodes = random.sample(range(100,1000), len(penguins))  # Sampling w/o replacement\n\n# Insert codes at the front of data frame\npenguins.insert(loc=0,  # Index\n                column='id_code',\n                value=codes)\n        \npenguins.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_code\nspecies\nisland\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nflipper_length_mm\nbody_mass_g\nsex\nyear\nbody_mass_kg\n\n\n\n\n0\n754\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n39.1\n18.7\n181.0\n3750.0\nmale\n2007\n3.75\n\n\n1\n214\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n39.5\n17.4\n186.0\n3800.0\nfemale\n2007\n3.80\n\n\n2\n125\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n40.3\n18.0\n195.0\n3250.0\nfemale\n2007\n3.25\n\n\n3\n859\nAdelie\nTorgersen\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n2007\nNaN\n\n\n4\n381\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n36.7\n19.3\n193.0\n3450.0\nfemale\n2007\n3.45",

This is an example of another way we might try to do it:\n\n# Select rows where 'sex' is 'female' and then attempt to update 'sex' column values\npenguins[penguins.sex=='female']['sex'] = 'F' # This raises SettingWithCopyWarning\n\n/var/folders/gm/chd1kps96_g7xdxyfw150wm80000gp/T/ipykernel_7781/534867616.py:2: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.\nTry using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  penguins[penguins.sex=='female']['sex'] = 'F' # This raises SettingWithCopyWarning\n\n\nWhen we select the data we want to update using chained indexing (two selection brackets [][]) instead of loc[] we get a SettingWithCopyWarning. With this warning, pandas is trying to alert us to a potential bug. In this case, the bug is that we actually did not update our data frame:\n\n# Confirm values were updated\nprint(penguins['sex'].unique())\n\n['M' 'female' nan]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid chained indexing [][] and use .loc[]\n\n\n\nThe SettingWithCopyWarning often arises from chained indexing:\ndf[df['col'] == value]['col2'] = new_value\nIn the words of the pandas documentation:\n\nassigning to the product of chained indexing has inherently unpredictable results.\n\nThe best practice is to use .loc[] instead:\ndf.loc[df['col'] == value,'col2'] = new_value\n.loc[] is generally more readable and explicitly modifies the original data frame.\nWarnings in Python are intended to be helpful and can prevent unintended data modification errors!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nUpdate the ‚Äúfemale‚Äù values in the penguins data frame to ‚ÄúF‚Äù. Don‚Äôt use chained indexing. Confirm that the values in the column were updated.\n\n\n\nTo understand why the SettingWithCopyWarning pops up we need to understand that some pandas operations return a view to your data, while others return a copy of your data.\n\nViews are actual subsets of the original data, when we update them, we are modifying the original data frame.\nCopies are unique objects, independent of our original data frames. When we update a copy we are not modifying the original data frame.\n\n\n\nDepending on what we are trying to do we might want to modify the original data frame or we might want to modify a copy.\n\nPandas raises the SettingWithCopyWarning because it tries to balance memory efficiency with data integrity. By default, it avoids creating unnecessary copies, but sometimes it‚Äôs ambiguous whether a subset should be independent (a copy) or connected (a view).\n\n\nWe only want to use data from Biscoe island and, after doing some analyses, we want to add a new column to it:\n\n# Select penguins from Biscoe island\nbiscoe = penguins[penguins.island=='Biscoe']\n\n# ... Other analyses ...\n\n# Add a column\nbiscoe['sample_col'] = 100  # This raises SettingWithCopyWarning\n\n/var/folders/gm/chd1kps96_g7xdxyfw150wm80000gp/T/ipykernel_7781/844154415.py:7: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.\nTry using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  biscoe['sample_col'] = 100  # This raises SettingWithCopyWarning\n\n\npandas is trying to alert you that it is unsure about whether biscoe is a view or a copy and it‚Äôs unclear whether an of our code will modify our dataset or not.\nTo fix this we can take control of the copy-view situation and explicitly ask for a copy of the dataset when subsetting the data. Use the copy() method to do this:\n\n# Make sure you get an independent data frame that won't alter the original\nbiscoe = penguins[penguins.island=='Biscoe'].copy()\n\n# Add a column, no warning\nbiscoe['sample_col'] = 100\n\nNow we are sure we did not modify our initial data, but rather the biscoe data frame:\n\n# Confirm the new column is in our subset data\nbiscoe.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nisland\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nsex\nyear\nbody_mass_kg\nflipper_length_cm\nobserver\nsize\nsample_col\n\n\nid_code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338\nAdelie\nBiscoe\n37.8\n18.3\nF\n2007\n3.40\n17.4\nA\nmedium\n100\n\n\n617\nAdelie\nBiscoe\n37.7\n18.7\nM\n2007\n3.60\n18.0\nC\nmedium\n100\n\n\n716\nAdelie\nBiscoe\n35.9\n19.2\nF\n2007\n3.80\n18.9\nC\nmedium\n100\n\n\n127\nAdelie\nBiscoe\n38.2\n18.1\nM\n2007\n3.95\n18.5\nB\nmedium\n100\n\n\n674\nAdelie\nBiscoe\n38.8\n17.2\nM\n2007\n3.80\n18.0\nC\nmedium\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Confirm that original data was not modified\nprint('sample_column' in penguins.columns)\n\nFalse\n\n\nThe SettingWithCopyWarning can be tricky, there are also false positives and false negatives.

    "text": "In this lesson we introduce the two core objects in the pandas library, the pandas.Series and the pandas.DataFrame. The overall goal is to gain familiarity with these two objects, understand their relation to each other, and review Python data structures such as dictionaries and lists.\n\n\nBy the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n\nExplain the relation between pandas.Series and pandas.DataFrame\nConstruct simple pandas.Series and pandas.DataFrame from scratch using different initalization methods\nPerform simple operations on pandas.Series\nNavigate the pandas documentation to look for attributes and methods of pandas.Series and pandas.DataFrame\n\n\n\n\npandas [1] [2] is a Python package to wrangle and analyze tabular data. It is built on top of NumPy and has become the core tool for doing data analysis in Python.\nThe standard abbreviation for pandas is pd. Here we will import it together with NumPy:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConvention: importing packages\n\n\n\nAlways import all your packages in a single cell at the top of you notebook! Following the PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code [3], each package or library import should be in a separate line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first core object of pandas is the series. A series is a one-dimensional array of indexed data.\n\n\n\nImage adapted from Introduction to GeoPandas.\n\n\nA pandas.Series having an index is the main difference between a pandas.Series and a NumPy array. Let‚Äôs see the difference:\n\n# A numpy array\narr = np.random.randn(4) # random values from std normal distribution\nprint(type(arr))\nprint(arr, \"\\n\")\n\n# A pandas series made from the previous array\ns = pd.Series(arr)\nprint(type(s))\nprint(s)\n\n&lt;class 'numpy.ndarray'&gt;\n[-0.11699598  0.6988026  -0.02075373  0.83663288] \n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.series.Series'&gt;\n0   -0.116996\n1    0.698803\n2   -0.020754\n3    0.836633\ndtype: float64\n\n\nNotice the index is printed as part of the pandas.Series while, although the np.array is indexable, the index is not part of this data structure. Printing the pandas.Series also shows the values and their data type.\n\n\n\nThe basic method to create a pandas.Series is to call\ns = pd.Series(data, index=index)\nThe data parameter can be:\n\na list or NumPy array,\na Python dictionary, or\na single number, boolean (True/False), or string.\n\nThe index parameter is optional, if we wish to include it, it must be a list of list of indices of the same length as data.\n\n\nLet‚Äôs create a pandas.Series from a NumPy array. To use this method we need to pass a NumPy array (or a list of objects that can be converted to NumPy types) as data. Here, we will also include the list [2023, 2024, 2025] to be used as an index:\n\n# A series from a numpy array \npd.Series(np.arange(3), index=[2023, 2024, 2025])\n\n2023    0\n2024    1\n2025    2\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we create a pandas.Series from a list of strings. Remember that the index parameter is optional. If we don‚Äôt include it, the default is to make the index equal to [0,...,len(data)-1]. For example:\n\n# A series from a list of strings with default index\npd.Series(['EDS 220', 'EDS 222', 'EDS 223', 'EDS 242'])\n\n0    EDS 220\n1    EDS 222\n2    EDS 223\n3    EDS 242\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that a dictionary is a set of key-value pairs. If we create a pandas.Series via a dictionary the keys will become the index and the values the corresponding data.\n\n# Construct dictionary\nd = {'key_0':2, 'key_1':'3', 'key_2':5}\n\n# Initialize series using a dictionary\npd.Series(d)\n\nkey_0    2\nkey_1    3\nkey_2    5\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndtype: object\n\n\n\nNotice that in this and the previous example the data type of the values in the series is object. This data type in pandas usually indicates that the series is made up of strings. However, we can see in this example that the object data type can also indicate a mix of strings and numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we only provide a single number, boolean, or string as the data for the series, we need to provide an index. The value will be repeated to match the length of the index. Here, we create a series from a single float number with an index given by a list of strings:\n\npd.Series(3.0, index = ['A', 'B', 'C'])\n\nA    3.0\nB    3.0\nC    3.0\ndtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArithmetic operations work on series and so most NumPy functions. For example:\n\n# Define a series\ns = pd.Series([98,73,65],index=['Andrea', 'Beth', 'Carolina'])\n\n# Divide each element in series by 10\nprint(s /10, '\\n')\n\n# Take the exponential of each element in series\nprint(np.exp(s), '\\n')\n\n# Original series is unchanged\nprint(s)\n\nAndrea      9.8\nBeth        7.3\nCarolina    6.5\ndtype: float64 \n\nAndrea      3.637971e+42\nBeth        5.052394e+31\nCarolina    1.694889e+28\ndtype: float64 \n\nAndrea      98\nBeth        73\nCarolina    65\ndtype: int64\n\n\nWe can also produce new pandas.Series with True/False values indicating whether the elements in a series satisfy a condition or not:\n\ns &gt; 70\n\nAndrea       True\nBeth         True\nCarolina    False\ndtype: bool\n\n\nThis kind of simple conditions on pandas.Series will be key when we are selecting data from data frames.\n\n\n\nIn pandas we can represent a missing, NULL, or NA value with the float value numpy.nan, which stands for ‚Äúnot a number‚Äù. Let‚Äôs construct a small series with some NA values represented this way:\n\n# Series with NAs in it\ns = pd.Series([1, 2, np.nan, 4, np.nan])\ns\n\n0    1.0\n1    2.0\n2    NaN\n3    4.0\n4    NaN\ndtype: float64\n\n\nNotice the data type of the values it he series is still float64.\nThe hasnans attribute for a pandas.Series returns True if there are any NA values in it and false otherwise:\n\n# Check if series has NAs\ns.hasnans\n\nTrue\n\n\nAfter detecting there are Na values, we might be intersted in knowing which elements in the series are NAs. We can do this using the isna method:\n\ns.isna()\n\n0    False\n1    False\n2     True\n3    False\n4     True\ndtype: bool\n\n\nThe ouput is a pandas.Series of boolean values indicating if an element in the row at the given index is np.nan (True = is NA) or not (False = not NA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\n\nThe integer number -999 is often used to represent missing values. Create a pandas.Series named s with four integer values, two of which are -999. The index of this series should be the the letters A through D.\n\n\n\nIn the pandas.Series documentation, look for the method mask(). Use this method to update the series s so that the -999 values are replaced by NA values. HINT: check the first example in the method‚Äôs documentation.\n\n\n\n\nThere‚Äôs much more to say about pandas.Series, but this is enough to get us going. At this point, we mainly want to know about pandas.Series because pandas.Series are the columns of a pandas.DataFrame.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pandas.DataFrame is the most used pandas object. It represents tabular data and we can think of it as a spreadhseet. Each column of a pandas.DataFrame is a pandas.Series.\n\n\n\nImage adapted from Introduction to GeoPandas.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many ways of creating a pandas.DataFrame. We present one simple one in this section.\nWe already mentioned each column of a pandas.DataFrame is a pandas.Series. In fact, the pandas.DataFrame is a dictionary of pandas.Series, with each column name being the key and the column values being the key‚Äôs value. Thus, we can create a pandas.DataFrame in this way:\n\n# Initialize dictionary with columns' data \nd = {'col_name_1' : pd.Series(np.arange(3)),\n     'col_name_2' : pd.Series([3.1, 3.2, 3.3]),\n     }\n\n# Create data frame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(d)\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncol_name_1\ncol_name_2\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n3.1\n\n\n1\n1\n3.2\n\n\n2\n2\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can change the index by changing the index attribute in the data frame:\n\n# Change index\ndf.index = ['a','b','c']\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncol_name_1\ncol_name_2\n\n\n\n\na\n0\n3.1\n\n\nb\n1\n3.2\n\n\nc\n2\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nWe can access the data frame‚Äôs column names via the columns attribute. Update the column names to C1 and C2 by updating this attribute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJump to the week 1 discussion section to practice preliminary data exploration with a real world dataset. Then, continue with the next lesson on subsetting data frames.",

We present one simple one in this section.\nWe already mentioned each column of a pandas.DataFrame is a pandas.Series. In fact, the pandas.DataFrame is a dictionary of pandas.Series, with each column name being the key and the column values being the key‚Äôs value. Thus, we can create a pandas.DataFrame in this way:\n\n# Initialize dictionary with columns' data \nd = {'col_name_1' : pd.Series(np.arange(3)),\n     'col_name_2' : pd.Series([3.1, 3.2, 3.3]),\n     }\n\n# Create data frame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(d)\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncol_name_1\ncol_name_2\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n3.1\n\n\n1\n1\n3.2\n\n\n2\n2\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can change the index by changing the index attribute in the data frame:\n\n# Change index\ndf.index = ['a','b','c']\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncol_name_1\ncol_name_2\n\n\n\n\na\n0\n3.1\n\n\nb\n1\n3.2\n\n\nc\n2\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nWe can access the data frame‚Äôs column names via the columns attribute. Update the column names to C1 and C2 by updating this attribute.",

This data comes in a GeoJSON file with the following attributes:\n\nname: name of Arctic community,\npopulation: population of Arctic community, as of 2022\ncountry: country that the Arctic community falls within (see dataset metadata for the codes)\ngeoname-id: numeric codes that uniquely identify all administrative/legal and statistical geographic areas for which the Census Bureau tabulates data\n\nThe second dataset is Natural Earth‚Äôs medium-scale cultural boundaries data for countries (1:50m). We can obtain this dataset by downloading the shapefile. Natural Earth is a public domain dataset with free, ready-to-use data for creating maps.\nThe third dataset we will use is a CSV file with the country codes and names of the Arctic countries in the Arctic communities dataset.

Remember all GeoJSON files are given in this CRS and all points are expressed in longitude and latitude units of decimal degrees.\n\nprint(countries.crs)\n\nEPSG:4326\n\n\nSince the CRSs of our geospatila data match, it is easy to take a quick look at our communities data by plotting it on top of the countries dataframe:\n\n# Verify CRSs match\nassert countries.crs == communities.crs\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ncountries.plot(ax=ax)\ncommunities.plot(ax=ax, color='red')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we import the country names and codes CSV:\n\ncountry_names = pd.read_csv(os.path.join('data','country_names.csv'))\ncountry_names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncountry\nadmin\n\n\n\n\n0\nRU\nRussia\n\n\n1\nLV\nLatvia\n\n\n2\nEE\nEstonia\n\n\n3\nLT\nLithuania\n\n\n4\nSE\nSweden\n\n\n5\nBY\nBelarus\n\n\n6\nFI\nFinland\n\n\n7\nNO\nNorway\n\n\n8\nDK\nDenmark\n\n\n9\nFO\nFaroe Islands\n\n\n10\nIS\nIceland\n\n\n11\nGB\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\n12\nAX\nAland Islands\n\n\n13\nGL\nGreenland\n\n\n14\nUS\nUnited States of America\n\n\n15\nCA\nCanada\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we want to calculate the number of Arctic communities by country.\n\n# Create data frame with number of communities per country\nn_comms = (communities.groupby('country')\n                      .size()\n                      .reset_index(name='n_communities'))\n\nLet‚Äôs break this down:\n\nWe start with our communities dataframe and use groupby('country') to group by country code.\nThen we use size() as an aggregator function to calculate the size of each group.\nThe result of this operation is a pandas.Series indexed by the country values.\nBy resetting the index we transform the pandas.Series into a pandas.DataFrame, the index is now a column named country and the values of the series are named n_communities.\n\n\n# Number of Arctic communities per country\nn_comms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncountry\nn_communities\n\n\n\n\n0\nAX\n1\n\n\n1\nBY\n8\n\n\n2\nCA\n7\n\n\n3\nDK\n72\n\n\n4\nEE\n14\n\n\n5\nFI\n98\n\n\n6\nFO\n1\n\n\n7\nGB\n96\n\n\n8\nGL\n1\n\n\n9\nIS\n5\n\n\n10\nLT\n26\n\n\n11\nLV\n25\n\n\n12\nNO\n48\n\n\n13\nRU\n774\n\n\n14\nSE\n133\n\n\n15\nUS\n115\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur goal is to merge the n_comms and the countries data frames. To merge two data frames they need to have at least one column in common. Currently our datasets do not have any columns in common:\n\nset(countries.columns).intersection(n_comms.columns)\n\nset()\n\n\nThe output set() represents the empty set. This might not be as informative, so let‚Äôs write a different information statement:\n\ncommon_columns = set(countries.columns).intersection(n_comms.columns)\n\n# Check if there are any common columns\nif len(common_columns) != 0:\n    print(f\"Common columns: {common_columns}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No common columns\")\n\nNo common columns\n\n\nRemember that an if-else statement is a control structure that allows code to make decisions: it checks a condition, and if that condition is true, it executes one block of code (the if block); if the condition is false, it executes a different block (the else block). This enables programs to respond differently depending on specific criteria or inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nWrap up the previous code into a function called check_common_columns that prints a message depending of whether two data frames have common columns or not. Don‚Äôt forget to include a docstring! \n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the country_names data frame to add the names countries into the n_comms data which, in turn, will allow us to merge that data frame with the country_names data. To merge dataframes we can use the pandas.merge() function. The basic syntax for it is:\noutput_df = pd.merge(left_df,\n                     right_df, \n                     how = type_of_join, \n                     on = column_to_join)\nwhere\n\noutput_df is the dataframe resulting from the merge,\nleft_df is the dataframe we have ‚Äúon the left side‚Äù,\nright_df is the dataframe we have ‚Äúon the right side‚Äù,\nhow specifies the type of join between the left and right dataframes, (check the options here), the default is to do an inner join,\non specifies the column to join on, this column must be present in both our dataframes.\n\nWhen merging a geopandas.GeoDataFrame with a pandas.DataFrame, the geopandas.GeoDataFrame must be ‚Äúon the left‚Äù to retain the geospatial information. Otherwise, the output will be a pandas.DataFrame.\nSo, we merge the n_comms and country_names data frames using a left join:\n\n\n\nImage source: Data Modeling Essentials, NCEAS Learning Hub [2]\n\n\n\nn_comms = pd.merge(n_comms,\n                   country_names,\n                   how='left',\n                   on='country')\nn_comms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncountry\nn_communities\nadmin\n\n\n\n\n0\nAX\n1\nAland Islands\n\n\n1\nBY\n8\nBelarus\n\n\n2\nCA\n7\nCanada\n\n\n3\nDK\n72\nDenmark\n\n\n4\nEE\n14\nEstonia\n\n\n5\nFI\n98\nFinland\n\n\n6\nFO\n1\nFaroe Islands\n\n\n7\nGB\n96\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\n8\nGL\n1\nGreenland\n\n\n9\nIS\n5\nIceland\n\n\n10\nLT\n26\nLithuania\n\n\n11\nLV\n25\nLatvia\n\n\n12\nNO\n48\nNorway\n\n\n13\nRU\n774\nRussia\n\n\n14\nSE\n133\nSweden\n\n\n15\nUS\n115\nUnited States of America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can reuse our function to check that n_comms and countries now have a common column on which we can merge them:\n\ncheck_common_columns(n_comms, countries)\n\nCommon columns: {'admin'}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nCreate a new variable named arctic_countries which is the result of an inner join between our countries and n_comms dataframes.

We can verify the value ‚ÄòAland Islands‚Äô was nowhere in our original countries dataframe like this:\n\n# Check Aland Islands is nowhere in data frame\n'Aland Islands' not in countries.values\n\nTrue\n\n\nThe Aland Islands is an autonomous region of Finland and there is one Arctic community registered in this region. We will directly add one to Finland to not lose this piece of data:\n\narctic_countries.at['Finland', 'n_communities'] += 1\n\n\n\n\nA choropleth map is an efficient way to visualize aggregate data per region.\nMaking a choropleth map from our polygons GeoDataFrame is easy; we just need to specify the column parameter in plot() and make it equal to the column with the values we want to plot in each country:\n\narctic_countries.plot(column='n_communities',\n                      legend=True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember that CRSs reflect cultural views and even biases. Any map projection involves choices about which areas to emphasize, minimize, or distort, and those choices can influence how viewers perceive different regions. In our map, using the EPSG:4326 CRS is, among other things, mapping the Arctic regions as far apart, while they are actually near each other.\nReprojecting means changing the coordinate reference system of your geospatial data. In our case, we will reproject the Alaska geo-dataframe to the CRS EPSG:3413. This CRS is a projected CRS, better suited for working with data from the Arctic region:\n\n\n\nSource: spatialreference.org\n\n\nChanging CRSs in GeoPandas is very simple using the to_crs() method for geopandas.GeoDataFrames. The general syntax is:\nupdated_geodf = geodf.to_crs(new_crs)\nwhere:\n\nupdated_geodf is the output of the method, a new geodataframe (to_crs() does not work in place),\ngeodf is the geopandas.GeoDataFrame we want to transform,\nnew_crs the CRS we want to convert to, this is an object of type CRS or string representing the CRS (ex: 'epsg:3413').\n\nIn our case:\n\n# Reproject to CRS optimized for Arctic region\narctic_countries = arctic_countries.to_crs('epsg:3413')\n\nWe can now use the reprojected data to update our map:\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))\n\n# Remove the axis for a cleaner map\nax.axis('off')\n\n# Create choropleth map of communities\n# Plot with refined color and edge style\narctic_countries.plot(\n    ax=ax,\n    column='n_communities',\n    cmap='PuBuGn',\n    legend=True,\n    edgecolor=\"0.6\",\n    linewidth=0.5,\n    legend_kwds={\n        \"shrink\": 0.7,\n        \"label\": \"Number of Arctic Communities\",\n        \"orientation\": \"horizontal\",\n        \"pad\": 0.05\n    }\n)\n\n# Add title and subtitle for better context\nax.set_title('Distribution of Arctic Communities', fontsize=18, weight='bold', pad=15)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the new projection clearly improves the presentation of the data, there are still issues with this plot! Mainly, the entire United States territory is in it, when we should only have Alaska. In our next lesson we will review startegies to clip and subset vector data and return to this plot in our discussion section.",

Any map projection involves choices about which areas to emphasize, minimize, or distort, and those choices can influence how viewers perceive different regions. In our map, using the EPSG:4326 CRS is, among other things, mapping the Arctic regions as far apart, while they are actually near each other.\nReprojecting means changing the coordinate reference system of your geospatial data. In our case, we will reproject the Alaska geo-dataframe to the CRS EPSG:3413. This CRS is a projected CRS, better suited for working with data from the Arctic region:\n\n\n\nSource: spatialreference.org\n\n\nChanging CRSs in GeoPandas is very simple using the to_crs() method for geopandas.GeoDataFrames. The general syntax is:\nupdated_geodf = geodf.to_crs(new_crs)\nwhere:\n\nupdated_geodf is the output of the method, a new geodataframe (to_crs() does not work in place),\ngeodf is the geopandas.GeoDataFrame we want to transform,\nnew_crs the CRS we want to convert to, this is an object of type CRS or string representing the CRS (ex: 'epsg:3413').\n\nIn our case:\n\n# Reproject to CRS optimized for Arctic region\narctic_countries = arctic_countries.to_crs('epsg:3413')\n\nWe can now use the reprojected data to update our map:\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))\n\n# Remove the axis for a cleaner map\nax.axis('off')\n\n# Create choropleth map of communities\n# Plot with refined color and edge style\narctic_countries.plot(\n    ax=ax,\n    column='n_communities',\n    cmap='PuBuGn',\n    legend=True,\n    edgecolor=\"0.6\",\n    linewidth=0.5,\n    legend_kwds={\n        \"shrink\": 0.7,\n        \"label\": \"Number of Arctic Communities\",\n        \"orientation\": \"horizontal\",\n        \"pad\": 0.05\n    }\n)\n\n# Add title and subtitle for better context\nax.set_title('Distribution of Arctic Communities', fontsize=18, weight='bold', pad=15)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the new projection clearly improves the presentation of the data, there are still issues with this plot! Mainly, the entire United States territory is in it, when we should only have Alaska.

Often, we want to calculate a certain statistic for each group. For example, suppose we want to calculate the average flipper length per species. How would we do this ‚Äúby hand‚Äù?\n\nWe start with our data and notice there are multiple species in the species column.\nWe split our original table to group all observations from the same species together.\nWe calculate the average flipper length for each of the groups we formed.\nThen we combine the values for average flipper length per species into a single table.\n\nThis is known as the Split-Apply-Combine strategy. This strategy follows the three steps we explained above:\n\nSplit: Split the data into logical groups (e.g.¬†species, sex, island, etc.)\nApply: Calculate some summary statistic on each group (e.g.¬†average flipper length by species, number of individuals per island, body mass by sex, etc.)\nCombine: Combine the statistic calculated on each group back together.\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit-apply-combine to calculate mean flipper length\n\n\n\nFor a pandas.DataFrame or pandas.Series, we can use the groupby() method to split (i.e.¬†group) the data into different categories.\nThe general syntax for groupby() is\ndf.groupby(columns_to_group_by).summary_method()\nMost often, we will have that columns_to_group_by will be a single column name (a string) or a list of column names. The unique values of the column (or columns) will be used as the groups of the data frame.\n\nExample\nIf we don‚Äôt use groupby() and directly apply the mean() method to our flipper length column, we obtain the average of all the values in the column:\n\npenguins['flipper_length_mm'].mean()\n\n200.91520467836258\n\n\nTo get the mean flipper length by species we first group our dataset by the species column‚Äôs values. However, if we just use the groupby() method without specifying what we wish to calculate on each group, not much happens up front:\n\npenguins.groupby('species')['flipper_length_mm']\n\n&lt;pandas.core.groupby.generic.SeriesGroupBy object at 0x149eda550&gt;\n\n\nWe get a GroupBy object, which is like an intermediate step. It doesn‚Äôt perform the actual calculations until we specify an operation:\n\n# Average flipper length per species\npenguins.groupby('species')['flipper_length_mm'].mean()\n\nspecies\nAdelie       189.953642\nChinstrap    195.823529\nGentoo       217.186992\nName: flipper_length_mm, dtype: float64\n\n\nLet‚Äôs recap what went on in that line (remember the . can be read as ‚Äúand then‚Ä¶‚Äù):\n\nstart with the penguins data frame, and then‚Ä¶\nuse groupby() to group the data frame by species values, and then‚Ä¶\nselect the 'flipper_length_mm' column, and then‚Ä¶\ncalculate the mean() of this column with respect to the groups.\n\nNotice that the name of the series is the same as the column on which we calculated the summary statistc. We can easily update this using the rename() method:\n\n# Average flipper length per species\navg_flipper = (penguins.groupby(\"species\")\n                        .flipper_length_mm\n                        .mean()\n                        .rename('mean_flipper_length')\n                        .sort_values(ascending=False)\n                        )\navg_flipper\n\nspecies\nGentoo       217.186992\nChinstrap    195.823529\nAdelie       189.953642\nName: mean_flipper_length, dtype: float64\n\n\nWe can also group by combinations of columns.\n\n\nExample\nWe want to know what was the number of penguins surveyed in each island on different years. We can use the count() method to count the number of non-NA values in each column like this:\n\npenguins.count()\n\nspecies              344\nisland               344\nbill_length_mm       342\nbill_depth_mm        342\nflipper_length_mm    342\nbody_mass_g          342\nsex                  333\nyear                 344\ndtype: int64\n\n\nWhen we group by island and year we get the count of non-NA values for each column across each combination of island and year:\n\npenguins.groupby(['island','year']).count()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nflipper_length_mm\nbody_mass_g\nsex\n\n\nisland\nyear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiscoe\n2007\n44\n44\n44\n44\n44\n43\n\n\n2008\n64\n64\n64\n64\n64\n63\n\n\n2009\n60\n59\n59\n59\n59\n57\n\n\nDream\n2007\n46\n46\n46\n46\n46\n45\n\n\n2008\n34\n34\n34\n34\n34\n34\n\n\n2009\n44\n44\n44\n44\n44\n44\n\n\nTorgersen\n2007\n20\n19\n19\n19\n19\n15\n\n\n2008\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n\n\n2009\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs say we want to plot the surveyed population per year and island. We could then use method chaining to do this:\n\n(penguins.groupby(['island','year'])\n         .count()\n         .species\n         .sort_values()\n         .plot(kind='barh',\n                title='Penguins surveyed at the Palmer Archipelago',\n                ylabel=('Island, Year'))\n         )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\n\nUse the max() method for pandas.DataFrames to calculate the maximum value of a penguin‚Äôs body mass by year and species.\n\n\n\nUse (1) to display the highest body masses per year and species as a bar plot in descending order.",

The values from the second column to the last column correspond to the number of different bird species recorded across the survey sites in each wetland during winter, spring, and fall of a given year. For example, the CSM_fall column has the number of species recorded in fall at Carpinteria Salt Marsh across years. The year column corresponds to the calendar year on which the data was collected. Surveys have happened yearly from 2010 to 2023.\n\n\n\nMugu Lagoon in Ventura County, California, seen from the Mugu Peak Trail.

The genereal syntax to do this is:\ndf['column_name']\nNotice the column name is given as string inside the square brackets. This is an example of label-based subsetting, which means we want to select data from our data frame using the names of the columns, not their position. When we select rows or column using their position, we are doing position-based subsetting. We‚Äôll see some methods to do this when we move into selecting rows.\n\n\nSuppose we are interested in the number of bird species observed at the Mugu Lagoon in spring. We can access that single column in this way:\n\n# Select a single column by using square brackets []\nmul_spring = df['MUL_spring']\n\n# Print first five elements in this column\nmul_spring.head()\n\n0     NaN\n1    52.0\n2    58.0\n3    58.0\n4    52.0\nName: MUL_spring, dtype: float64\n\n\nSince we only selected a single column, mul_spring is a pandas.Series:\n\n# Check the type of the ouput\nprint(type(mul_spring))\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.series.Series'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npd.DataFrame = dictionary of columns\n\n\n\nRemember we can think of a pandas.DataFrame as a dictionary of its columns? Then we can access a single column using the column name as the key, just like we would do in a dictionary. That is the we just used: df['column_name'].\n\n\nWe can also do label-based subsetting of a single column using attribute syntax:\ndf.column_name\nFor example, to see the head of the MUL_spring column we would do:\n\ndf.MUL_spring.head()\n\n0     NaN\n1    52.0\n2    58.0\n3    58.0\n4    52.0\nName: MUL_spring, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavor df['column_name'] instead of df.column_name\n\n\n\nIn general, it is better to use the df['column_name'] syntax. A couple reasons why are:\n\ndf['column_name'] can take in any column name, while df.column_name only works if the column name has no spaces or special characters\ndf['column_name'] avoids conflicts with pd.DataFrame methods and attributes. For example, if df has a column named count, it‚Äôs ambiguous whether pd.count is referring to the count() method or the count column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can select multiple columns in a single call by passing a list with the column names to the square brackets []:\ndf[['column_1', 'column_10', 'column_245']]\nNotice there are double square brackets. This is because we are passing the list of names ['column_1', 'column_10', 'column_245'] to the selection brackets [].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nIs this an example of label-based selection or location-based selection?\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to look at the species in the Tijuana Estuary during winter and fall, then we can select these columns like this:\n\n# Select columns with names \"TJE_winter\" and \"TJE_fall\"\ntje_wf = df[['TJE_winter','TJE_fall']]\n\nNotice there are double square brackets. This is because we are passing the list of names ['TJE_winter','TJE_fall'] to the selection brakcets [].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nWhat is the type and shape of the tje_wf output? Verify your answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo select a slice of the columns we will use a special case of loc selection (we‚Äôll cover the general one by the end of the lesson). The syntax will be\ndf.loc[ : , 'column_start':'column_end']\nwhere column_start and column_end are, respectively, the starting point and endpoint of the column slice we want to subset from the data frame.\nNotice two things:\n\nthe first value passed to loc is used for selecting rows, using a colon : as the row-selection parameter means ‚Äúselect all the rows‚Äù\nthe slice of the data frame we‚Äôll obtain includes both endpoints of the slice 'column_start':'column_end'. In other words, we‚Äôll get the column_start column and the column_end column. This is different from how slicing works in base Python and NumPy, where the endpoint is not included.\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs select the slice of columns that covers all data from Carpinteria Salt Marsh and Mugu Lagoon. This corresponds to all columns between CSM_winter and MUL_fall.\n\n# Select columns between 'CSM_winter' and 'MUL_fall'\ncsm_mul = df.loc[:,'CSM_winter':'MUL_fall']\ncsm_mul.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSM_winter\nCSM_spring\nCSM_fall\nMUL_winter\nMUL_spring\nMUL_fall\n\n\n\n\n0\n39.0\n40.0\n50.0\n45.0\nNaN\n61.0\n\n\n1\n48.0\n44.0\nNaN\n58.0\n52.0\nNaN\n\n\n2\n51.0\n43.0\n49.0\n57.0\n58.0\n53.0\n\n\n3\n42.0\n46.0\n38.0\n60.0\n58.0\n62.0\n\n\n4\n38.0\n43.0\n45.0\n49.0\n52.0\n57.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we are familiar with some methods for selecting columns, let‚Äôs move on to selecting rows.\n\n\nSelecting rows that satisfy a particular condition is one of the most usual kinds of row subsetting. The general syntax for this type of selection is\ndf[condition_on_rows]\nThat condition_of_rows can be a myriad things, let‚Äôs see some usual scenarios.\n\n\nSuppose we are intersted in all data after 2020.

Sometimes we may want to select certain rows depending on their actual position in the data frame. In other words, using position-based subsetting.

These parameters can be a condition or a subset of labels from the index or the column names.\n\n\nLet‚Äôs select the winter surveys for Mugu Lagoon and the Tijuana Estuary after 2020:\n\ndf.loc[df['year']&gt;2020, ['MUL_winter','TJE_winter']]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMUL_winter\nTJE_winter\n\n\n\n\n11\n54.0\n53.0\n\n\n12\n60.0\n60.0\n\n\n13\n72.0\n60.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs break down this code:\n\nwe are using the df.loc[ row-selection , column-selection] syntax\nthe row-selection parameter is the condition df['year']&gt;2020, which is a boolean array saying which years are greater than 2020\nthe column-selection parameter is ['MUL_winter','TJE_winter'], which is a list with the names of the two columns we are interested in.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we want to select rows and columns simultaneously by position we use iloc selection with the syntax:\ndf.iloc[ row-indices , column-indices]\n\n\nSuppose we want to select rows 3-7 (including 7) and columns 3 and 4:\n\ndf.iloc[3:8, [3,4]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSM_fall\nMUL_winter\n\n\n\n\n3\n38.0\n60.0\n\n\n4\n45.0\n49.0\n\n\n5\n45.0\n58.0\n\n\n6\n47.0\n63.0\n\n\n7\n43.0\n57.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs break it down:\n\nwe are using the df.iloc[ row-indices , column-indices] syntax to select by position\nthe row-indices parameter is the slice of integer indices 3:8. Remember the right endpoint (8) won‚Äôt be included.\nthe column-indices parameter is the list of integer indices 3 and 4. This means we are selecting the fourth and fifth column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niloc vs.¬†loc: which one does what?\n\n\n\nAt the beginning, the difference between iloc and loc can be confusing. Remember the i in iloc stands for integer location, this reminds us iloc only uses integer indexing to retrieve information from the data frames in the same way as indexing for Python lists.\nIf you want to dive deeper, this is a great discussion about the difference between iloc and loc: Stackoverflow - How are iloc and loc different?\nAnd, as always, the documentation will provide you with more information: pandas.DataFrame.loc and pandas.DataFrame.iloc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niloc for column selection? Avoid it!\n\n\n\nWe can also access columns by position using iloc - but it is best not to if possible.\nSuppose we want to access the 9th column in the data frame - then we want to select a column by position. In this case, the 9th column is the data at San Dieguito Wetland during spring and the 9th position corresponds to the index 8. We can select this column by position using the iloc selection:\n\n# Select column by position using iloc\n# The syntax is iloc[row-indices, column-indices]\n# [:,8] means \"select all rows from the 8th column\"\nsdw_spring = df.iloc[:,8]\nsdw_spring.head()\n\n0    75.0\n1    74.0\n2    72.0\n3    70.0\n4    78.0\nName: SDW_spring, dtype: float64\n\n\nUnless you are really looking for information about the 9th column, do not access a column by position. This is bound to break in many ways:\n\nit relies on a person correctly counting the position of a column. Even with a small dataset this can be prone to error.\nit is not explicit: if we want information about San Dieguito Wetland during spring, df.SDW_spring or df['SDW_spring'] are explicitely telling us we are accessing that information. df.iloc[:,8] is obscure and uninformative.\ndatastets can get updated. Maybe a new column was added before SDW_spring, this would change the position of the column, which would make any code depending on df.iloc[:,8] invalid.\n\nAccessing columns by labels helps reproducibility!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Flow diagram for selecting core methods to subset a pandas.DataFrame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is presented in this section is not an exhaustive list of methods to select data in pandas.DataFrames.

    "text": "Selecting a single column by column name is the simplest case for selecting data in a data frame. The genereal syntax to do this is:\ndf['column_name']\nNotice the column name is given as string inside the square brackets. This is an example of label-based subsetting, which means we want to select data from our data frame using the names of the columns, not their position. When we select rows or column using their position, we are doing position-based subsetting. We‚Äôll see some methods to do this when we move into selecting rows.\n\n\nSuppose we are interested in the number of bird species observed at the Mugu Lagoon in spring. We can access that single column in this way:\n\n# Select a single column by using square brackets []\nmul_spring = df['MUL_spring']\n\n# Print first five elements in this column\nmul_spring.head()\n\n0     NaN\n1    52.0\n2    58.0\n3    58.0\n4    52.0\nName: MUL_spring, dtype: float64\n\n\nSince we only selected a single column, mul_spring is a pandas.Series:\n\n# Check the type of the ouput\nprint(type(mul_spring))\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.series.Series'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npd.DataFrame = dictionary of columns\n\n\n\nRemember we can think of a pandas.DataFrame as a dictionary of its columns? Then we can access a single column using the column name as the key, just like we would do in a dictionary. That is the we just used: df['column_name'].\n\n\nWe can also do label-based subsetting of a single column using attribute syntax:\ndf.column_name\nFor example, to see the head of the MUL_spring column we would do:\n\ndf.MUL_spring.head()\n\n0     NaN\n1    52.0\n2    58.0\n3    58.0\n4    52.0\nName: MUL_spring, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavor df['column_name'] instead of df.column_name\n\n\n\nIn general, it is better to use the df['column_name'] syntax. A couple reasons why are:\n\ndf['column_name'] can take in any column name, while df.column_name only works if the column name has no spaces or special characters\ndf['column_name'] avoids conflicts with pd.DataFrame methods and attributes. For example, if df has a column named count, it‚Äôs ambiguous whether pd.count is referring to the count() method or the count column.",

Remember the i in iloc stands for integer location, this reminds us iloc only uses integer indexing to retrieve information from the data frames in the same way as indexing for Python lists.\nIf you want to dive deeper, this is a great discussion about the difference between iloc and loc: Stackoverflow - How are iloc and loc different?\nAnd, as always, the documentation will provide you with more information: pandas.DataFrame.loc and pandas.DataFrame.iloc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niloc for column selection? Avoid it!\n\n\n\nWe can also access columns by position using iloc - but it is best not to if possible.\nSuppose we want to access the 9th column in the data frame - then we want to select a column by position. In this case, the 9th column is the data at San Dieguito Wetland during spring and the 9th position corresponds to the index 8. We can select this column by position using the iloc selection:\n\n# Select column by position using iloc\n# The syntax is iloc[row-indices, column-indices]\n# [:,8] means \"select all rows from the 8th column\"\nsdw_spring = df.iloc[:,8]\nsdw_spring.head()\n\n0    75.0\n1    74.0\n2    72.0\n3    70.0\n4    78.0\nName: SDW_spring, dtype: float64\n\n\nUnless you are really looking for information about the 9th column, do not access a column by position. This is bound to break in many ways:\n\nit relies on a person correctly counting the position of a column. Even with a small dataset this can be prone to error.\nit is not explicit: if we want information about San Dieguito Wetland during spring, df.SDW_spring or df['SDW_spring'] are explicitely telling us we are accessing that information. df.iloc[:,8] is obscure and uninformative.\ndatastets can get updated. Maybe a new column was added before SDW_spring, this would change the position of the column, which would make any code depending on df.iloc[:,8] invalid.\n\nAccessing columns by labels helps reproducibility!",

These intense storms bring strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges that significantly impact both terrestrial and coastal ecosystems. Hurricanes can cause widespread deforestation, alter habitats, and disrupt biodiversity, affecting, among other habitats, mangroves and coral reefs.\n\n\n\nHurricane Mitch (Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale) impacted the Yucatan Peninsula in late October 1998, with its effects felt most strongly around October 28-29. The Yucatan experienced heavy rains and flooding as Mitch passed near the region. Image source: NOAA\n\n\nThis dataset includes information about the Saffir-Simpson hurricane category for each hurricane. The Saffir-Simpson scale is a widely used classification system that categorizes hurricanes based on their sustained wind speeds and potential for damage. Ranging from Category 1 to Category 5, the scale assesses the intensity of hurricanes, with Category 1 being the least severe and Category 5 representing catastrophic storms. Categories 3 and above are considered major hurricanes, capable of causing significant structural damage, flooding, and long-lasting environmental impacts."

This dataset is stored at ScienceBase, a digital repository from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) created to share scientific data products and USGS resources.\nThe dataset is a CSV file containing conflict or crisis around water resource management in the Colorado River Basin. The Colorado River Basin, inhabited by several Native American tribes for centuries, is a crucial water source in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, supporting over 40 million people, extensive agricultural lands, and diverse ecosystems. Its management is vital due to the region‚Äôs arid climate and the competing demands for water, leading to significant challenges related to water allocation and conservation.\n\n\n\nColorado River Basin.

    "text": "Vector data is one of the two primary types of geospatial data (the other one being raster data). In this section we will review what vector data is and go over some common data formats for it.\n\n\n\nVector data represents specific features on the Earth‚Äôs surface. There are three core types of vector data:\n\nPoints: each point has a single \\(x\\),\\(y\\) location. Examples of data that can be represented as point vector data are sampling locations or animal sightings.\nLines: a line is composed of at least two points that are connected. Roads and streams are commonly depicted as line vector data.\nPolygons: polygons are sets of three or more vertices that are connected and form a closed region. Political boundaries (outlines of countries, states, cities, etc) are examples of polygon vector data.\n\nEach item in the vector data is usually referred to as a feature. So each point would be a feature, each polygon is a feature, etc.\n\n\n\nImage Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)\n\n\nBesides points, lines, and polygons, we can also encounter an additional type of vector data:\n\nMultipolygons: represent features made up of several polygons. Each polygon can be a separate, disconnected area, but together they form one feature. For example, a country with both mainland and island territories is often represented as a multi-polygon. Multi-polygons are useful for geographic entities that consist of multiple regions but need to be treated as a single unit in analysis.\n\nIn addition to the geospatial information stored, vector data can include attributes that describe each feature. For example, a vector dataset where each feature is a polygon representing the boundary of a state could have as attributes the population and area of the state.\n\n\n\nImage Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most popular formats to store vector data is the shapefile data format. The shapefile format is developed and maintained by the Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri).\nSo far we have been working with data that comes stored in a single file, like a CSV or .txt file for tabular data. A shapefile is actually a collection of files that interact together to create a single data file. All the files that make up a shapefile need to have the same name (with different extensions) and be in the same directory. For our shapefiles to work we need at least these three files:\n\n.shp: shape format, this file has the geometries for all features.\n.shx: shape index format, this file indexes the features\n.dbf: attribute format, this file stores the attributes for features as a table\n\nSometimes shapefiles will have additional files, including:\n\n.prj: a file containing information about the projection and coordinate reference system\n.sbn and .sbx: files that contain a spatial index of the features\n.shp.xml: geospatial metadata in XML format.\n\nCheck the Wikipedia page about shapefiles to see a more extensive list of files associated to shapefiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile management for shapefiles\n\n\n\nRemember: when working with a shapefile all the associated files must have the same name (with different extensions) and must be located in the same directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA single shapefile can only have one vector type\n\n\n\nEach shapefile can only hold one type of vector data. You cannot have, for example, lines and points in the same file. Only points, only lines, or only polygons can be inside a single shapefile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoJSON, which stands for Geographic JavaScript Object Notation, is an open format for encoding vector data (points, lines, polygons, and multipolygons) and their attributes. It is a popular format for web mapping applications. The GeoJSON format uses a single file, with extension .json or .geojson.\nWhile shapefiles can be in any coordinate reference system, the GeoJSON specification requires GeoJSON files to use the World Geodetic System 1984 (EPSG:4326/WGS84) CRS and all points must be expressed in longitude and latitude units of decimal degrees.\nData in a GeoJSON is stored as attribute-value pairs (similar to Python dictionaries!) and lists. The following are examples of how points, lines, and polygons are represented as GeoJSON features:\n\n\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n\nThe followng is an example of a full GeoJSON file.

    "text": "GeoPandas is a Python library that extends the pandas library by adding support for geospatial data. In this lesson we will introduce the geopandas library to work with vector data. We will also make our first map.\n\n\n\nWild pigs (Sus scrofa) are a destructive invasive species in California, causing significant environmental and agricultural damage. Introduced to the region in the 1700s, they have since spread across the state, impacting native ecosystems through habitat destruction, soil disturbance due to their rooting behavior, and competition with native wildlife for food [1]. This widespread damage has made managing wild pig populations a critical issue for conservation and agricultural communities in California.\n\n\n\nWild boar in Santa Teresa Park, CA. Photo by Don DeBold\n\n\nIn this lesson we will use simplified point data about wild pig sightings in California from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). GBIF is an international network and data platform that provides open access to biodiversity data from around the world. By aggregating data from multiple sources, including museums, research institutions, and citizen science initiatives, GBIF enables scientists, policymakers, and the public to explore and analyze species distribution and environmental trends.\nThe data we will use today has been simplified from the complete Sus scrofa occurrencies data [2] accessed through the GBIF website.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this lesson we will introduce three Python packages:\n\ngeopandas [3]: a package that extends pandas to work with geospatial data. This is the main package we will be working with in the next few lessons.\nos: a package that provides functions for interacting with the operating system, allowing us to perform tasks like file manipulation in a platform-independent way.\nmatplotlib [4]: one of the most popular and widely used Python libraries for data visualization.\n\nLet‚Äôs start by importing these packages:\n\nimport os\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nTo import our data we will first use the os package to create a reproducible file path:\n\nfp = os.path.join('data','gbif_sus_scrofa_california','gbif_sus_scrofa_california.shp')\nfp\n\n'data/gbif_sus_scrofa_california/gbif_sus_scrofa_california.shp'\n\n\nUsing the os.path.join() function allows us to create file paths that work on any operating system. Each operating system uses a different way to separate folders in a path (e.g., Windows uses backslashes \\, while macOS and Linux use forward slashes /). By using os.path.join(), Python automatically handles the correct separator for the operating system you‚Äôre working on. This avoids errors and makes your code more portable.\nWe can then use this file path to read in a shapefile with geopandas by using the geopandas.read_file() function:\n\npigs = gpd.read_file(fp)\npigs.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngbifID\nspecies\nstate\nindividual\nday\nmonth\nyear\ninst\ncollection\ncatalogNum\nidentified\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n899953814\nSus scrofa\nCalifornia\nNaN\n22.0\n3.0\n2014.0\niNaturalist\nObservations\n581956\nedwardrooks\nPOINT (-121.53812 37.08846)\n\n\n1\n899951348\nSus scrofa\nCalifornia\nNaN\n9.0\n6.0\n2007.0\niNaturalist\nObservations\n576047\nBruce Freeman\nPOINT (-120.54942 35.47354)\n\n\n2\n896560733\nSus scrofa\nCalifornia\nNaN\n20.0\n12.0\n1937.0\nMVZ\nHild\nMVZ:Hild:195\nMuseum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of Ca...\nPOINT (-122.27063 37.87610)\n\n\n3\n896559958\nSus scrofa\nCalifornia\nNaN\n1.0\n4.0\n1969.0\nMVZ\nHild\nMVZ:Hild:1213\nMuseum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of Ca...\nPOINT (-121.82297 38.44543)\n\n\n4\n896559722\nSus scrofa\nCalifornia\nNaN\n1.0\n1.0\n1961.0\nMVZ\nHild\nMVZ:Hild:1004\nMuseum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of Ca...\nPOINT (-121.74559 38.54882)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne shapefile = multiple files\n\n\n\nAlthough the parameter for geopandas.read_file() is only the file with .shp extension, remember that we need to have at least the .shx and .dbf files in the same directory as the .shp to read in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nCreate a file path using os.path.join() to import the shapefile of the California state boundary as a geopandas.GeoDataFrame.

We can think of it as a pandas.DataFrame with a dedicated geometry column that can perform spatial operations.\nThe geometry column in a geopandas.GeoDataFrame holds the geometry (point, polygon, etc) of each spatial feature. This geometry column is of type geopandas.GeoSeries. Columns in the geopandas.GeoDataFrame with attributes about the features are pandas.Series like in a regular pandas.DataFrame.\n\n\n\nImage adapted from Introduction to GeoPandas.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, notice that the leftmost column of the pigs geo-dataframe is a column named geometry whose values indicate points:\n\npigs.head(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngbifID\nspecies\nstate\nindividual\nday\nmonth\nyear\ninst\ncollection\ncatalogNum\nidentified\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n899953814\nSus scrofa\nCalifornia\nNaN\n22.0\n3.0\n2014.0\niNaturalist\nObservations\n581956\nedwardrooks\nPOINT (-121.53812 37.08846)\n\n\n1\n899951348\nSus scrofa\nCalifornia\nNaN\n9.0\n6.0\n2007.0\niNaturalist\nObservations\n576047\nBruce Freeman\nPOINT (-120.54942 35.47354)\n\n\n2\n896560733\nSus scrofa\nCalifornia\nNaN\n20.0\n12.0\n1937.0\nMVZ\nHild\nMVZ:Hild:195\nMuseum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of Ca...\nPOINT (-122.27063 37.87610)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs usual, we can check the type of our objects using the type Python function:\n\n# Check the data type of the pigs dataframe \nprint(type(pigs))\n\n# Check the data type of the geometry column\nprint(type(pigs.geometry))\n\n# Check the data type of the gbifID column\nprint(type(pigs.gbifID))\n\n&lt;class 'geopandas.geodataframe.GeoDataFrame'&gt;\n&lt;class 'geopandas.geoseries.GeoSeries'&gt;\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.series.Series'&gt;\n\n\nThe data type of the geometry column is also reflected when we look at the data types of the values in each column:\n\n# Check the data type of each column\npigs.dtypes\n\ngbifID           int64\nspecies         object\nstate           object\nindividual     float64\nday            float64\nmonth          float64\nyear           float64\ninst            object\ncollection      object\ncatalogNum      object\nidentified      object\ngeometry      geometry\ndtype: object\n\n\nWe can also check the type of each element in the geometry column using the geom_type attribute of a geopandas.GeoDataFrame:\n\npigs.geom_type\n\n0       Point\n1       Point\n2       Point\n3       Point\n4       Point\n        ...  \n1041    Point\n1042    Point\n1043    Point\n1044    Point\n1045    Point\nLength: 1046, dtype: object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nWhat is the geometry type of the single feature in the California state boundary?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo other important attributes of a geopandas.GeoDataFrame are its coordinate reference system (CRS) and its extent.\nWe can think of the coordinate reference system (CRS) as the instructions to locate each spatial feature of our data frame on the surface of the Earth. We access the CRS of a geopandas.GeoDataFrame using the crs attribute:\n\n\n# Access the CRS of the GeoDataFrame\npigs.crs\n\n&lt;Geographic 2D CRS: EPSG:4326&gt;\nName: WGS 84\nAxis Info [ellipsoidal]:\n- Lat[north]: Geodetic latitude (degree)\n- Lon[east]: Geodetic longitude (degree)\nArea of Use:\n- name: World.\n- bounds: (-180.0, -90.0, 180.0, 90.0)\nDatum: World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble\n- Ellipsoid: WGS 84\n- Prime Meridian: Greenwich\n\n\n\nThe extent of the geo-dataframe is the bounding box covering all the spatial features in our geo-dataframe. This is formed by finding the points that are furthest west, east, south, and north.\n\n\n\nSpatial extent of different vector data. Image adapted from: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)\n\n\nWe access the extent of a geopandas.GeoDataFrame using the total_bounds attribute:\n\n# Obtain the geographic extent of the geo-dataframe\npigs.total_bounds\n\narray([-124.29448 ,   32.593433, -115.4356  ,   40.934296])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nPrint the CRS, and extent of the California boundary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoPandas is conveniently built on top of pandas, so we may use everything we have learned about data selection, wrangling, and modification for a pandas.DataFrame to wrange geopandas.GeoDataFrames.\n\n\nWe only want to use recent data for wild pig observations. A quick check shows that this dataframe has data since 1818:\n\n# Examine pig observation by year\npigs['year'].value_counts().sort_index()\n\nyear\n1818.0     31\n1910.0      1\n1925.0      1\n1927.0      4\n1929.0      3\n         ... \n2019.0    101\n2020.0    159\n2021.0    164\n2022.0    185\n2023.0     98\nName: count, Length: 61, dtype: int64\n\n\nWe can use our usual data selection to get data from 2020 onwards:\n\n# Select data from 2020 onwards\npigs_recent = pigs[pigs.year&gt;=2020]\n\n# Check length of original dataframe\nprint('Total number of observations: ' , len(pigs))\n\n# Check length of new dataframe\nprint('Number of observations since 2020: ' , len(pigs_recent))\n\nTotal number of observations:  1046\nNumber of observations since 2020:  606\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly to a pandas.DataFrame, a geopandas.GeoDataFrame has a plot() method that we can call directly to create a quick view of our data. The geospatial information of the geopandas.GeoDataFrame will be used to create the axes of the plot.\n\n\nLet us take a quick look at our recent pigs data:\n\npigs_recent.plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing forward, we will make more complex visualizations where we add different layers to a graph and customize it. To do this, we will use the matplotlib Python library for creating visualizations. We can interact with matplotlib via its pyplot interface, which we imported at the top of the notebook.\nMatplotlib graphs the data in a figure which can have one or more axes. The axes is only the area specified by the \\(x\\) axis and \\(y\\) axis and what is plotted in it, while the figure can icnlude multiple axes in it.\n\n\n\nImage source: Getting Started with Matplotlib\n\n\nTo create a new blank figure:\n\nInitialize a new figure and axes by calling pyplot‚Äôs subplots() function, and\nshow the graph using plt.show():\n\n\n# Initialize empyt figure (fig) and axis (ax)\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Display figure\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that plt.subplots() is a function that returns two objects, when we call it, get a figure fig with a single empty axis ax. We can think of this step as setting a new blank canvas on which we will paint upon.\n\n\n\nWhen using matplotlib, it can be useful to think of creating a plot as adding layers to an axis. The general syntax to plot a datafram df onto an axis is:\n# Initialize empyt figure and axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Plot a df on the ax axis\ndf.plot(ax=ax,  # Add plot to axis\n        ...)    # Other arguments for plot function\n\n# Display figure\nplt.show()\n\n\nThe first layer that we want to add to our axis is the pigs_recent point data. We can plot our data using matplotlib like this:\n\n# Initialize empyt figure and axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Add pigs point plot to our figure's axis\npigs_recent.plot(ax=ax)\n\n# Display figure\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatplotlib allows for a lot of customization. Some of it can be done directly in the plot() method for the dataframe (like we‚Äôve done when ploting data using pandas), while other is done by updating attributes of the axis ax. The following diagram shows some examples of elements in the axis that can be updated.\n\n\n\nImage source: Matplotlib documentation\n\n\n\n\nSome basic customization for our pigs data could looke like this:\n\n# Initialize empty figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Add data to axis\npigs_recent.plot(ax=ax,         # Add plot to axis\n                 alpha=0.5,     # Adjust transparency\n                 color='brown'  # Update point color\n                 )\n\n# Update axis \nax.set_title('Reported \"Sus scrofa\" sightings in CA (2020-2023)')\nax.set_xlabel('Longitude')\nax.set_ylabel('Latitude')\n\n# Display figure\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nAdd the California state boundary to the plot so the boundary appears behind the points as below. Don‚Äôt forget to customize your graph!",

    "text": "Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are a destructive invasive species in California, causing significant environmental and agricultural damage. Introduced to the region in the 1700s, they have since spread across the state, impacting native ecosystems through habitat destruction, soil disturbance due to their rooting behavior, and competition with native wildlife for food [1]. This widespread damage has made managing wild pig populations a critical issue for conservation and agricultural communities in California.\n\n\n\nWild boar in Santa Teresa Park, CA. Photo by Don DeBold\n\n\nIn this lesson we will use simplified point data about wild pig sightings in California from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). GBIF is an international network and data platform that provides open access to biodiversity data from around the world. By aggregating data from multiple sources, including museums, research institutions, and citizen science initiatives, GBIF enables scientists, policymakers, and the public to explore and analyze species distribution and environmental trends.\nThe data we will use today has been simplified from the complete Sus scrofa occurrencies data [2] accessed through the GBIF website.",

    "text": "In this lesson we will introduce three Python packages:\n\ngeopandas [3]: a package that extends pandas to work with geospatial data. This is the main package we will be working with in the next few lessons.\nos: a package that provides functions for interacting with the operating system, allowing us to perform tasks like file manipulation in a platform-independent way.\nmatplotlib [4]: one of the most popular and widely used Python libraries for data visualization.\n\nLet‚Äôs start by importing these packages:\n\nimport os\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nTo import our data we will first use the os package to create a reproducible file path:\n\nfp = os.path.join('data','gbif_sus_scrofa_california','gbif_sus_scrofa_california.shp')\nfp\n\n'data/gbif_sus_scrofa_california/gbif_sus_scrofa_california.shp'\n\n\nUsing the os.path.join() function allows us to create file paths that work on any operating system. Each operating system uses a different way to separate folders in a path (e.g., Windows uses backslashes \\, while macOS and Linux use forward slashes /). By using os.path.join(), Python automatically handles the correct separator for the operating system you‚Äôre working on. This avoids errors and makes your code more portable.\nWe can then use this file path to read in a shapefile with geopandas by using the geopandas.read_file() function:\n\npigs = gpd.read_file(fp)\npigs.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngbifID\nspecies\nstate\nindividual\nday\nmonth\nyear\ninst\ncollection\ncatalogNum\nidentified\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n899953814\nSus scrofa\nCalifornia\nNaN\n22.0\n3.0\n2014.0\niNaturalist\nObservations\n581956\nedwardrooks\nPOINT (-121.53812 37.08846)\n\n\n1\n899951348\nSus scrofa\nCalifornia\nNaN\n9.0\n6.0\n2007.0\niNaturalist\nObservations\n576047\nBruce Freeman\nPOINT (-120.54942 35.47354)\n\n\n2\n896560733\nSus scrofa\nCalifornia\nNaN\n20.0\n12.0\n1937.0\nMVZ\nHild\nMVZ:Hild:195\nMuseum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of Ca...\nPOINT (-122.27063 37.87610)\n\n\n3\n896559958\nSus scrofa\nCalifornia\nNaN\n1.0\n4.0\n1969.0\nMVZ\nHild\nMVZ:Hild:1213\nMuseum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of Ca...\nPOINT (-121.82297 38.44543)\n\n\n4\n896559722\nSus scrofa\nCalifornia\nNaN\n1.0\n1.0\n1961.0\nMVZ\nHild\nMVZ:Hild:1004\nMuseum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of Ca...\nPOINT (-121.74559 38.54882)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne shapefile = multiple files\n\n\n\nAlthough the parameter for geopandas.read_file() is only the file with .shp extension, remember that we need to have at least the .shx and .dbf files in the same directory as the .shp to read in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nCreate a file path using os.path.join() to import the shapefile of the California state boundary as a geopandas.GeoDataFrame.

The following diagram shows some examples of elements in the axis that can be updated.\n\n\n\nImage source: Matplotlib documentation\n\n\n\n\nSome basic customization for our pigs data could looke like this:\n\n# Initialize empty figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Add data to axis\npigs_recent.plot(ax=ax,         # Add plot to axis\n                 alpha=0.5,     # Adjust transparency\n                 color='brown'  # Update point color\n                 )\n\n# Update axis \nax.set_title('Reported \"Sus scrofa\" sightings in CA (2020-2023)')\nax.set_xlabel('Longitude')\nax.set_ylabel('Latitude')\n\n# Display figure\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nAdd the California state boundary to the plot so the boundary appears behind the points as below.

Follow these steps to download shapefile with the United States‚Äô states:\n\nAt the bottom of the 2022 page, under Download, click on ‚ÄúWeb Interface‚Äù\nFor year, select 2022, and for layer type select ‚ÄúStates (and equivalent)‚Äù. Click submit.\nClick on ‚ÄúDownload national file‚Äù.\n\nYou can check the metadata for all the TIGER shapefiles here. The columns for this shapefile are:\n\n\n\nSource: TIGER/Line Shapefiles Technical Documentation\n\n\nThe second dataset we‚Äôll use is Natural Earth‚Äôs simple medium scale populated places dataset. We can obtain this dataset by downloading the shapefile (choose the one that says ‚Äúsimple (less columns)‚Äù).\nThe third dataset we‚Äôll use is Natural Earth‚Äôs road dataset. We can obtain this dataset by downloading the shapefile\nWe will combine these datasets to create the following map of infrastructure in Alaska:\n\nFor these notes, all the data is inside a data/ directory at the same level as the notebook.\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs start by loading our libraries and then importing the datasets we will use. \n\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport geopandas as gpd\n\nfrom shapely.geometry import box  # To create polygon bounding box\n\npd.set_option(\"display.max.columns\", None)\n\n# -------------------------------------\n# Import and simplify states polygons\nstates = gpd.read_file(os.path.join('data',\n                                    'tl_2022_us_state',\n                                    'tl_2022_us_state.shp')\n                                    )\n\n# Import Natural Earth populated places points\nplaces = gpd.read_file(os.path.join('data',\n                                    'ne_50m_populated_places_simple',\n                                    'ne_50m_populated_places_simple.shp')\n                                    )\n\n# Import ferry routes lines\nroads = gpd.read_file(os.path.join('data',\n                                   'ne_10m_roads',\n                                   'ne_10m_roads.shp')\n                                   )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nUse a for loop to iterate over the three geo-dataframes we imported and change their column names to lower caps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs start by taking taking a look at our states geo-dataframe.

(15.79900 40.64200)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplaces.plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset has the EPSG:4326 CRS. Remember this is the EPSG code for the WGS 84 CRS. This is not a surprise since the places data is global and EPSG:4326/WGS84 is the most widely used CRS for such data.\nLet‚Äôs see what happens when we try to plot this data on top of Alaska:\n\n# Trouble\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nalaska.plot(ax=ax)\nplaces.plot(ax=ax, color='red')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData in weird places? Check your CRSs\n\n\n\nThis is a classic slip in geospatial analysis. To plot, analyze, or integrate different geospatial datasets they must have the same CRS.\nHere, alaska and places have different CRSs, leading to unexpected results when plotting them together:\n\nalaska.crs == places.crs\n\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nReproject the places geo-datafarme into alaska‚Äôs CRS and verify the CRSs match using assert.\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs check that map again:\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nalaska.plot(ax=ax)\nplaces.plot(ax=ax, color='red', markersize=2)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is better: we can see there the Alaska poygons and some of the places points on top of it. Our next step is to select these points.\n\n\n\n\nClipping means using a polygon (or polygons) to only select geospatial data within them. Clipping a geopandas.GeoDataFrame is simple using the geopandas clip() function. The general syntax is:\nupdated_geodf = geopandas.clip(geodf, mask)\nwhere:\n\nupdated_geodf is the output of the method: the intersection of the geometries in geodf with mask,\ngeodf is the geopandas.GeoDataFrame we want to clip,\nmask is a geopandas.GeoDataFrame with the polygon(s) we want to use for clipping. This mask must be in the same CRS as geodf!\n\nIn our case:\n\n# Clip populated places to Alaska multipolygon\nak_places = gpd.clip(places, alaska)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nalaska.plot(ax=ax)\nak_places.plot(ax=ax, color='red')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we move on to our roads dataset.\n\nprint(roads.crs)\n\nroads.head(3)\n\nEPSG:4326\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscalerank\nfeaturecla\ntype\nsov_a3\nnote\nedited\nname\nnamealt\nnamealtt\nrouteraw\nquestion\nlength_km\ntoll\nne_part\nlabel\nlabel2\nlocal\nlocaltype\nlocalalt\nlabelrank\nignore\nadd\nrwdb_rd_id\norig_fid\nprefix\nuident\ncontinent\nexpressway\nlevel\nmin_zoom\nmin_label\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n8\nRoad\nSecondary Highway\nCAN\nNone\nVersion 1.5: Changed alignment, a few adds in ...\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\n0\n3\n0\nne_1d4_original\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nNone\n314705\nNorth America\n0\nNone\n7.1\n9.6\nLINESTRING (-133.32533 62.21571, -133.31664 62...\n\n\n1\n7\nRoad\nSecondary Highway\nUSA\nNone\nVersion 1.5: Changed alignment, a few adds in ...\n83\nNone\nNone\nNone\n0\n164\n0\nne_1d4_original\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nNone\n108105\nNorth America\n0\nFederal\n7.0\n8.6\nLINESTRING (-100.50543 42.80753, -100.53495 42...\n\n\n2\n7\nRoad\nSecondary Highway\nUSA\nNone\nVersion 1.5: Changed alignment, a few adds in ...\n840\nNone\nNone\nNone\n0\n98\n0\nne_1d4_original\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nNone\n0\nNorth America\n0\nU/C\n7.0\n9.5\nLINESTRING (-87.27432 36.02439, -87.22916 35.9...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nroads.plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have already noticed that the roads data is not in the same CRS as the alaska polygons, so these geo-datasets shound‚Äôt interact until they‚Äôre in the same CRS. Before jumping right into reprojecting and clipping, we will subset the data to select only US roads:\n\nusa_roads = roads[roads.sov_a3 == 'USA']\nusa_roads.plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduce your tabular data before reducing via geometries\n\n\n\nGeospatial operations are usually costly in terms of computing power. The more detailed our geometries are, the longer in takes to do geospatial computations. It‚Äôs a good practice to reduce your data as much as possible before applying any geospatial transformation.\n\n\n\nWe will now compose functions to clip usa_roads using the alaska multipolygon. Notice we are using the ouput of usa_roads.to_crs(alaska.crs) directly and thus not changing the usa_roads geo-dataframe or creating new variables:\n\n# Clip usa_roads to alaska geometry\nak_roads = gpd.clip(usa_roads.to_crs(alaska.crs), alaska)\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nalaska.plot(ax=ax)\nak_roads.plot(ax=ax, color='red')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how the lines break on the small islands? However, in the usa_roads there are no broken lines. This should make us suspect we are leaving data out and clipping exactly to the polygons in alaska is not quite what we want.\n\n\nWe will clip the usa_roads geo-dataframe with the bounding box of alaska instead of its polygons. To create a bounding box, we first use the box() function we imported from shapely.geometry. The syntax for box() is:\nbox(minx, miny, maxx, maxy)\nthe output is a polygon representing a box constructed like this:\n\n\n\nImage adapted from: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)\n\n\nIf we want to create a shapely polygon from the bounds of a geo-dataframe gdf, a more straightforward syntax is:\nbox(*gdf.total_bounds)\nIn our case:\n\nbbox = box(*alaska.total_bounds)\nprint(type(bbox))\nbbox\n\n&lt;class 'shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* = unpacking operator\n\n\n\nIn the last syntax we used the asterisk * as an unpacking operator on the array alaska.total_bounds. Think about it as unpacking the elements of alaska.total_bounds and assigning them one-by-one to the paremeters minx, miny, maxx, maxy of the box() function.\nThis is a good article explaining more about unpacking with * in Python: https://geekflare.com/python-unpacking-operators/\n\n\nNotice that the bounding box is not a geodataframe, it is a stand alone, abstract polygon without any geospatial information. To interpret this polygon as something on the Earth‚Äôs surface we need to wrap it into a geo-datfrane abd assign it a CRS:\n\n# Create geo-dataframe from bounding box\nak_bbox = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry = [bbox],  # Assign geometry column\n                           crs = alaska.crs)  # Assign CRS\nprint(type(ak_bbox))\nak_bbox\n\n&lt;class 'geopandas.geodataframe.GeoDataFrame'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nPOLYGON ((1493082.309 404545.108, 1493082.309 ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now clip the roads using Alaska‚Äôs bounding box:\n\nak_complete_roads = gpd.clip(usa_roads.to_crs(ak_bbox.crs), ak_bbox)\n\nNotice the difference between the two clipping methods:\n\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(10,10))\n\nak_roads.plot(ax=ax1)\nax1.set_title('Roads clipped with AK multipolygon')\n\nak_complete_roads.plot(ax=ax2)\nax2.set_title('Roads clipped with AK bounding box')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can put all our data together in the same map:\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(11,5))\nax.axis('off')\n\nalaska.plot(ax=ax, color='whitesmoke', edgecolor='0.7')\n\nak_complete_roads.plot(ax=ax, \n                       zorder=1,  # Specify layer plotting order\n                       column='type', \n                       legend=True,\n                       legend_kwds={'title': \"Road Types\", \n                                    'loc': 'upper left',\n                                    'bbox_to_anchor':(0,0.9),\n                                    'fontsize':'small'}\n                                    )\n\nak_places.plot(ax=ax, \n               zorder=2,  # Specify layer plotting order\n               color='red', \n               marker='s'  # Square marker\n               )\n# Add city names as text annotations\nfor x, y, name in zip(ak_places.geometry.x, ak_places.geometry.y, ak_places['name']):\n    ax.text(x-30000, y+20000, name, fontsize=8, ha='right')\n\nax.set_title(\"Road Networks and Major Cities in Alaska\", fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nNotice the overlaying labels for Anchorage and Valdez:\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the map so these labels do not overlap. One way to do it is using an if when iterating over the Alaska populated places.",

Before jumping right into reprojecting and clipping, we will subset the data to select only US roads:\n\nusa_roads = roads[roads.sov_a3 == 'USA']\nusa_roads.plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduce your tabular data before reducing via geometries\n\n\n\nGeospatial operations are usually costly in terms of computing power. The more detailed our geometries are, the longer in takes to do geospatial computations. It‚Äôs a good practice to reduce your data as much as possible before applying any geospatial transformation.\n\n\n\nWe will now compose functions to clip usa_roads using the alaska multipolygon. Notice we are using the ouput of usa_roads.to_crs(alaska.crs) directly and thus not changing the usa_roads geo-dataframe or creating new variables:\n\n# Clip usa_roads to alaska geometry\nak_roads = gpd.clip(usa_roads.to_crs(alaska.crs), alaska)\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nalaska.plot(ax=ax)\nak_roads.plot(ax=ax, color='red')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how the lines break on the small islands? However, in the usa_roads there are no broken lines. This should make us suspect we are leaving data out and clipping exactly to the polygons in alaska is not quite what we want.\n\n\nWe will clip the usa_roads geo-dataframe with the bounding box of alaska instead of its polygons. To create a bounding box, we first use the box() function we imported from shapely.geometry. The syntax for box() is:\nbox(minx, miny, maxx, maxy)\nthe output is a polygon representing a box constructed like this:\n\n\n\nImage adapted from: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)\n\n\nIf we want to create a shapely polygon from the bounds of a geo-dataframe gdf, a more straightforward syntax is:\nbox(*gdf.total_bounds)\nIn our case:\n\nbbox = box(*alaska.total_bounds)\nprint(type(bbox))\nbbox\n\n&lt;class 'shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* = unpacking operator\n\n\n\nIn the last syntax we used the asterisk * as an unpacking operator on the array alaska.total_bounds. Think about it as unpacking the elements of alaska.total_bounds and assigning them one-by-one to the paremeters minx, miny, maxx, maxy of the box() function.\nThis is a good article explaining more about unpacking with * in Python: https://geekflare.com/python-unpacking-operators/\n\n\nNotice that the bounding box is not a geodataframe, it is a stand alone, abstract polygon without any geospatial information. To interpret this polygon as something on the Earth‚Äôs surface we need to wrap it into a geo-datfrane abd assign it a CRS:\n\n# Create geo-dataframe from bounding box\nak_bbox = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry = [bbox],  # Assign geometry column\n                           crs = alaska.crs)  # Assign CRS\nprint(type(ak_bbox))\nak_bbox\n\n&lt;class 'geopandas.geodataframe.GeoDataFrame'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nPOLYGON ((1493082.309 404545.108, 1493082.309 ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now clip the roads using Alaska‚Äôs bounding box:\n\nak_complete_roads = gpd.clip(usa_roads.to_crs(ak_bbox.crs), ak_bbox)\n\nNotice the difference between the two clipping methods:\n\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(10,10))\n\nak_roads.plot(ax=ax1)\nax1.set_title('Roads clipped with AK multipolygon')\n\nak_complete_roads.plot(ax=ax2)\nax2.set_title('Roads clipped with AK bounding box')\n\nplt.show()",

    "text": "This is a short review about some core concepts in Python exemplified by objects in the NumPy library. The goal is to recall basic Python vocabulary that will be used throughout the course, rather than to serve as an introduction to Python programming.\n\n\nBy the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n\nDefine and provide examples for basic terms in Python programming like variable, object, function, class, attribute, and method.\nRecognize optional and non-optional arguments in a function.\nUnderstand some of the basic differences in R and Python syntax.\n\n\n\n\nA library is a collection of code that we can use to perform specific tasks in our programs. It can be a single file or multiple ones. NumPy [1] is one of the core libraries for numerical computing in Python. Many of the libraries we will use in this course use NumPy‚Äôs arrays as their building blocks. Additionally, NumPy objects have been optimized for processing, so computations on them are really fast and use less memory than doing the equivalent using the core Python data structures.\nIn this lesson we will use NumPy to review some fundamental concepts in Python you should be already familiar with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary or package?\n\n\n\nA package in Python refers to a specific way of organizing multiple files of code into a directory hierarcy, often within a large code library. The words ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù and ‚Äúpackage‚Äù are often used interchangeably. NumPy, for example, is both a library and a package.\n\n\nLet‚Äôs start by importing the NumPy library by using the standard to abbreviation, np:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nBy importing numpy, all the objects and functions in this library will be available for us to use in our notebook.\n\n\n\nWe can think of a variable as a name we assign to a particular object in Python. For example:\n\n# Assign a small array to variable a\na = np.array([[1,1,2],[3,5,8]])\n\nWhen we run the cell, we store the variables and their value. We can view a variable‚Äôs value in two ways from within our Jupyter notebook:\n\nrunning a cell with the variable name\nusing the print function to print the value\n\n\n# Show the value\na\n\narray([[1, 1, 2],\n       [3, 5, 8]])\n\n\n\n# Print the value \nprint(a)\n\n[[1 1 2]\n [3 5 8]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR and Python: assigning values\n\n\n\nRemember that in Python we use the equal sign = to assign values to variables in the same way the left-arrow &lt;- is used in R:\n# R: assign value 10 to variable a\na &lt;- 10\n# Python: assign value 10 to variable a\na = 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConvention: Use snake_case for naming variables\n\n\n\nThere are many ways of constructing multi-word variable names. In this course we will name variables using snake_case, where words are all in small caps and separated by underscores (ex: raw_data, fires_2023). This is the naming convention suggested by the PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code [2]. Remember variable names should be both descriptive and concise!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will often encounter the word object in Python documentation and tutorials. Informally speaking, an object is a bundle of properties and actions about something specific. For example, an object could represent a data frame with properties such as number of rows, names of columns, and date created, and actions suchs as selecting a specific row or adding a new column.\nA variable is the name we give a specific object, and the same object can be referenced by different variables. An analogy for this is the following: the Sun (object) is called ‚Äúsol‚Äù in Spanish and ‚Äúsoleil‚Äù in French, so two different names (variables) represent the same object. You can read more technical details about the difference between objects and variables in Python here [3].\nIn practice, we can often use the word variable and object interchangeably (for example, in the next subsection!). I want to bring up what objects are so you are not caught off-guard with vocabulary you will often encounter in the documentation, StackExchange, etc.\n\n\n\nEvery object in Python has a type, the type tells us what kind of object it is. We can also call the type of an object, the class of an object, so class and type both mean what kind of object we have.\nWe can see the type/class of a variable/object by using the type function:\n\nprint(a)\ntype(a)\n\n[[1 1 2]\n [3 5 8]]\n\n\nnumpy.ndarray\n\n\nThe numpy.ndarray is the core object/data type in the NumPy package. We can check the type of an entry in the array by indexing:\n\nprint(a[0,0])\ntype(a[0,0])\n\n1\n\n\nnumpy.int64\n\n\nNotice the type of the value 1 in the array is numpy.int64 and not just the standard Python integer type int. The NumPy type numpy.int64 is telling us 1 is an integer stored as a 64-bit number. NumPy has its own data types to deal with numbers depending on memory storage and floating point precision, click here to know see all the types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR and Python: indexing\n\n\n\nRemember that in Python the indexing starts from 0, while in R it starts from 1. If you learned R first, this might seem odd but it‚Äôs easy to get used to it with some practice. A way to understand this 0-indexing is that, in Python, the index indicates the displacement from the start of the collection. So ‚Äò0 index in an array‚Äô means ‚Äòzero displacement from the start of the array‚Äô, in other words, the first element of the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nHow would you access the value 5 in the array a?\n\n\nSince ‚Äúeverything in Python is an object‚Äù and every object belongs to a class, we will interact with SO MANY classes in this course. Often, knowing the type of an object is the first step to finding information to code what you want!\n\n\n\nprint was our first example of a Python function. Functions take in a set of arguments, separated by commas, and use those arguments to create an output. There are several built-in funcions in Python, most of them are for interacting with the Python basic data types such as int (integers), float (decimal numbers), str (strings), and bool (boolean values).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument or parameter?\n\n\n\nIn this course we will use argument and parameter interchangeably. They do, however, have related but different meanings.\nA parameter is a variable in the function definition that accepts an argument passed to the function. It is a placeholder in the function that will receive the value of an argument when the function is called.\nFor example, in the function\ndef my_function(parameter1, parameter2):\n    return parameter1 + parameter2\nparameter1 and parameter2 are parameters. When we call the function\nresult = my_function(5, 10)\nwe have that 5 and 10 are arguments passed to the function my_function.\nYou will probably see parameter more often in a package‚Äôs documentation!\n\n\nWe can ask for information about what a function does function by executing ? followed by the function name:\n\n?print\n\n\nWhat we obtain is a docstring, a special type of comment that is used to document how a function (or class, or module) works. The first line in the docstring is telling us the function name followed by all of its arguments in parentheses. Then there is a short description of what the function does. And finally a list of the arguments and a brief explanation about each of them.\nYou can see there are different types of arguments inside the parenthesis. Roughly speaking, a function has two types of arguments:\n\nnon-optional arguments: arguments you need to specify for the function to do something, and\noptional arguments: arguments that are pre-filled with a default value by the function, but you can override them. Optional arguments appear inside the parenthesis () in the form optional_argument = default_value.\n\n\n\nend is a parameter in print with the default value a new line. We can pass the value ^_^ to this parameter so that finishes the line with ^_^ instead:\n\nprint('changing the default end argument of the print function', end=' ^_^')\n\nchanging the default end argument of the print function ^_^\n\n\nNotice that before we had always used print without specifying any value for the end parameter.\n\n\n\n\nAn object in Python has attributes and methods. An attribute is a property of the object, some piece of information about it. A method is a procedure associated with an object, so it is an action where the main ingredient is the object.\nFor example, these could be some attributes and methods for class cat:\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nMore formally, a method is a function that acts on the object it is part of.\nWe can access a variable‚Äôs attributes and methods by adding a period . at the end of the variable‚Äôs name. So we would write variable.variable_method() or variable.variable_attribute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nSuppose we have a class fish, make a diagram similar to the cat class diagram showing 3 attributes for the class and 3 methods.\n\n\n\n\nNumPy arrays have many methods and attributes. Let‚Äôs see some concrete examples.\n\n# A 3x3 array\nvar = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\nvar\n\narray([[1, 2, 3],\n       [4, 5, 6],\n       [7, 8, 9]])\n\n\nT is an example of attribute, it returns the transpose of var:\n\nprint(var.T)\nprint(type(var.T))\n\n[[1 4 7]\n [2 5 8]\n [3 6 9]]\n&lt;class 'numpy.ndarray'&gt;\n\n\nshape, another attribute, tells us the shape of the array:\n\nprint(var.shape)\nprint(type(var.shape))\n\n(3, 3)\n&lt;class 'tuple'&gt;\n\n\nndim is an attribute holding the number of array dimensions\n\nprint(var.ndim)\nprint(type(var.ndim))\n\n2\n&lt;class 'int'&gt;\n\n\nNotice these attributes can have many different data types. Here we saw a tuple and an int (two of the basic Python classes) and also a NumPy array as attributes of var.\nNow some examples of methods.\nThe tolist method returns the array as a nested list of scalars:\n\nvar.tolist()\n\n[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n\n\nThe min method returns the minimum value in the array along a specified axis:\n\nvar.min(axis=0)\n\narray([1, 2, 3])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nWe can also call the min method without any parameters:\n\nvar.min()\n\n1\n\n\nWhat kind of parameter is axis in our previous call of the var method?\n\n\nRemember, methods are functions associated to an object. We can confirm this!\n\ntype(var.tolist)\n\nbuiltin_function_or_method\n\n\n\ntype(var.min)\n\nbuiltin_function_or_method\n\n\nYou can see a complete list of NumPy array‚Äôs methods and attributes in the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR and Python: are there methods in R?\n\n\n\nIt is uncommon to use methods within an object in R. Rather, functions are extrinsic to the objects they are acting on. In R, for example, there would usually be two separate items: the variable var and a separate function min that gets var as a parameter:\n# This is R code\nvar &lt;- array(c(1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9), dim =c(3,3))\nmin(var)\nUsing the pipe operator %&gt;% in R‚Äôs tidyverse is closer to the dot . in Python:\n# This is R code\nvar &lt;- array(c(1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9), dim =c(3,3))\nvar %&gt;% min()\nWhat happens here is that the pipe %&gt;% is passing var to the min() function as its first argument. This is similar to what happens in Python when a function is a method of a class:\n# This is Python code\nvar = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\nvar.min()\nWhen working in Python, remember that methods are functions that are part of an object and a method uses the object it is part of to produce some information.",

So ‚Äò0 index in an array‚Äô means ‚Äòzero displacement from the start of the array‚Äô, in other words, the first element of the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nHow would you access the value 5 in the array a?\n\n\nSince ‚Äúeverything in Python is an object‚Äù and every object belongs to a class, we will interact with SO MANY classes in this course. Often, knowing the type of an object is the first step to finding information to code what you want!",

    "text": "print was our first example of a Python function. Functions take in a set of arguments, separated by commas, and use those arguments to create an output. There are several built-in funcions in Python, most of them are for interacting with the Python basic data types such as int (integers), float (decimal numbers), str (strings), and bool (boolean values).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument or parameter?\n\n\n\nIn this course we will use argument and parameter interchangeably. They do, however, have related but different meanings.\nA parameter is a variable in the function definition that accepts an argument passed to the function. It is a placeholder in the function that will receive the value of an argument when the function is called.\nFor example, in the function\ndef my_function(parameter1, parameter2):\n    return parameter1 + parameter2\nparameter1 and parameter2 are parameters. When we call the function\nresult = my_function(5, 10)\nwe have that 5 and 10 are arguments passed to the function my_function.\nYou will probably see parameter more often in a package‚Äôs documentation!\n\n\nWe can ask for information about what a function does function by executing ? followed by the function name:\n\n?print\n\n\nWhat we obtain is a docstring, a special type of comment that is used to document how a function (or class, or module) works. The first line in the docstring is telling us the function name followed by all of its arguments in parentheses. Then there is a short description of what the function does. And finally a list of the arguments and a brief explanation about each of them.\nYou can see there are different types of arguments inside the parenthesis. Roughly speaking, a function has two types of arguments:\n\nnon-optional arguments: arguments you need to specify for the function to do something, and\noptional arguments: arguments that are pre-filled with a default value by the function, but you can override them. Optional arguments appear inside the parenthesis () in the form optional_argument = default_value.\n\n\n\nend is a parameter in print with the default value a new line. We can pass the value ^_^ to this parameter so that finishes the line with ^_^ instead:\n\nprint('changing the default end argument of the print function', end=' ^_^')\n\nchanging the default end argument of the print function ^_^\n\n\nNotice that before we had always used print without specifying any value for the end parameter.",

    "text": "An object in Python has attributes and methods. An attribute is a property of the object, some piece of information about it. A method is a procedure associated with an object, so it is an action where the main ingredient is the object.\nFor example, these could be some attributes and methods for class cat:\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nMore formally, a method is a function that acts on the object it is part of.\nWe can access a variable‚Äôs attributes and methods by adding a period . at the end of the variable‚Äôs name. So we would write variable.variable_method() or variable.variable_attribute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nSuppose we have a class fish, make a diagram similar to the cat class diagram showing 3 attributes for the class and 3 methods.\n\n\n\n\nNumPy arrays have many methods and attributes. Let‚Äôs see some concrete examples.\n\n# A 3x3 array\nvar = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\nvar\n\narray([[1, 2, 3],\n       [4, 5, 6],\n       [7, 8, 9]])\n\n\nT is an example of attribute, it returns the transpose of var:\n\nprint(var.T)\nprint(type(var.T))\n\n[[1 4 7]\n [2 5 8]\n [3 6 9]]\n&lt;class 'numpy.ndarray'&gt;\n\n\nshape, another attribute, tells us the shape of the array:\n\nprint(var.shape)\nprint(type(var.shape))\n\n(3, 3)\n&lt;class 'tuple'&gt;\n\n\nndim is an attribute holding the number of array dimensions\n\nprint(var.ndim)\nprint(type(var.ndim))\n\n2\n&lt;class 'int'&gt;\n\n\nNotice these attributes can have many different data types. Here we saw a tuple and an int (two of the basic Python classes) and also a NumPy array as attributes of var.\nNow some examples of methods.\nThe tolist method returns the array as a nested list of scalars:\n\nvar.tolist()\n\n[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n\n\nThe min method returns the minimum value in the array along a specified axis:\n\nvar.min(axis=0)\n\narray([1, 2, 3])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nWe can also call the min method without any parameters:\n\nvar.min()\n\n1\n\n\nWhat kind of parameter is axis in our previous call of the var method?\n\n\nRemember, methods are functions associated to an object. We can confirm this!\n\ntype(var.tolist)\n\nbuiltin_function_or_method\n\n\n\ntype(var.min)\n\nbuiltin_function_or_method\n\n\nYou can see a complete list of NumPy array‚Äôs methods and attributes in the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR and Python: are there methods in R?\n\n\n\nIt is uncommon to use methods within an object in R. Rather, functions are extrinsic to the objects they are acting on. In R, for example, there would usually be two separate items: the variable var and a separate function min that gets var as a parameter:\n# This is R code\nvar &lt;- array(c(1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9), dim =c(3,3))\nmin(var)\nUsing the pipe operator %&gt;% in R‚Äôs tidyverse is closer to the dot . in Python:\n# This is R code\nvar &lt;- array(c(1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9), dim =c(3,3))\nvar %&gt;% min()\nWhat happens here is that the pipe %&gt;% is passing var to the min() function as its first argument. This is similar to what happens in Python when a function is a method of a class:\n# This is Python code\nvar = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\nvar.min()\nWhen working in Python, remember that methods are functions that are part of an object and a method uses the object it is part of to produce some information.",

    "text": "f-strings\nSo far, we have printed variables using string concatenation inside the print() function. This means that we write commas between every string and variable we want to print, and then the print() function concatenates these into a single string. For example:\n\nprint('CRS: ', power_plants.crs)\n\nCRS:  EPSG:4269\n\n\nAnother popular way of mixing strings and variables in print statements is by creating an f-string which stands for ‚Äúformatted string‚Äù. The simplest syntax for an f-string is:\nf\" some text {replace}\"\nwhere replace can be a variable, an expression, or a function or method call. For example:\n\n# Explore CRS\nprint(f\"ellipsoid: {power_plants.crs.ellipsoid}\")\nprint(f\"datum: {power_plants.crs.datum}\")\n\nellipsoid: GRS 1980\ndatum: North American Datum 1983\n\n\nWe just created a string replacing the value inside the curly brackets {}.\nOne of the advantages of using f-strings is that they offer customization for formatting the output:\n\n# Set the label width to 25 characters, aligning the answers\nprint(f\"{'Is the CRS geographic?:':&lt;25} {power_plants.crs.is_geographic}\")\nprint(f\"{'Is the CRS projected?:':&lt;25} {power_plants.crs.is_projected}\")\n\nIs the CRS geographic?:   True\nIs the CRS projected?:    False\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse f-strings or not?\n\n\n\nWhether you use an f-string or simply concatenate strings with variables inside your print statements depends entirely on the application. For quickly checking a variable, a print statement might be enough, while using f-strings can be better to include custom messages during runtime. The best tool can be different depending on the task!\nThese are some good resources to learn more about f-string formatting:\n\nReal Python - Python‚Äôs F-String for String Interpolation and Formatting\nPython documentation- Format Specification Mini-Language",

    "text": "for with zip\nOften, we need to iterate simultaneously over two lists (or other iterables). The zip() function in Python allows you to combine two or more lists (or other iterables) so that you can iterate over their elements in pairs. When used with a for loop, it lets you process elements from each list together, like this example:\n\n# Iterate over a single list\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3]\nfor num in numbers:\n    print(num)\n\nprint('\\n')  # Blank line\n\n# Iterate over two lists in pairs using zip()\nletters = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nfor num, letter in zip(numbers, letters):\n    print(num, letter)\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n1 a\n2 b\n3 c\n\n\nLet‚Äôs see a practical application of for loops and zip() with matplotlib subplots. A common situation when code gets repeated is when creating subplots. For example:\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=3, figsize=(7, 3))\n\naxes[0].set_title('This is axis 0')\naxes[1].set_title('This is axis 1')\naxes[2].set_title('This is axis 2')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, notice that the axes variable returned by the plt.subplots() function is actually an array of axes we can iterate over.

    "text": "Functions\nNext, we want to keep exploring these maps of the top 3 electric primary sources for different states. This is a scenario where creating functions can be useful. In Python, functions are blocks of reusable code designed to perform specific tasks, helping to make your code more modular and organized. The general syntax for defining a function is the following:\ndef function_name(parameter_1, ..., parameter_n):\n    \"\"\"Docstring\"\"\"\n    &lt;body of the function&gt;\n    return value  # Depending on the function\nWe define a function using:\n\nthe def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses (which can contain parameters), and a colon.\nThe first line(s) of the function should be a docstring, this is a special kind of comment used to describe what the function will do. It must be indented and in between triple quotes \"\"\".\nAfter the docstring, you write the body of the function, this is the code that will be executed when the function is called. The wholek body of the function should be indentated to indicate the function‚Äôs scope.\nThe return keywork is used to allow the function to return values. Functions that do not return any values don‚Äôt need to have a return keyword.\n\nLet‚Äôs see two simple examples just to get familiar with the syntax. In the first one we have a simple function with a one-line docstring, no parameters, and no return values.\ndef greet():\n   \"\"\"Print a greeting message.\"\"\"\n   print(\"Hello, welcome to the class!\")\nThe second one has a single parameter and a more detailed docstring with information abou the arguments and return values.\ndef calculate_area(radius):\n   \"\"\"\n   Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.\n   \n   Args:\n       radius (float): The radius of the circle.\n       \n   Returns:\n       float: The area of the circle, calculated as œÄ * radius^2.\n   \"\"\"\n   area = 3.14159 * radius ** 2\n   return area\n\nExample\nGoing back to our power plants data frame, let‚Äôs create a function that will give us the top 3 primary energy sources for a given state:\n\ndef top3_sources(state, power_plants):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the top 3 electric primary sources of given state.\n    \n    Args:\n        state (str): The US state we want information about.\n        power_plants (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing data \n        on power plants, with at least 'state' and 'primsource' columns.\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of the top 3 primary sources of the state within the power_plants data frame.\n    \"\"\"\n    state_power_plants = power_plants[power_plants['state']==state]\n    top_sources = (state_power_plants['primsource']\n                                .value_counts()\n                                .index[:3]\n                                .tolist()\n                                )\n    return top_sources\n\nWe may now reuse this function as much as we want!\n\nprint('Top 3 primary energy sources in Division 2 states:')\nfor state in ['New Jersey', 'New York', 'Pennsylvania']:\n    print(state, ': ', top3_sources(state, power_plants))\n\nTop 3 primary energy sources in Division 2 states:\nNew Jersey :  ['solar', 'natural gas', 'biomass']\nNew York :  ['solar', 'hydroelectric', 'natural gas']\nPennsylvania :  ['natural gas', 'solar', 'biomass']\n\n\nLet‚Äôs do one more example and create a function that will produce a plot given a list of primary sources and a state name:\n\ndef plot_3_energy_sources(state, sources, power_plants):\n    \n    # Raise error if there are more than three sources\n    assert len(sources) == 3, 'sources must have three elements to produce the plot'\n\n    # Isolate the state boundary and power plants\n    boundary = states[states.name==state]\n    state_power_plants = power_plants[power_plants['state']==state]\n\n    # Create plot\n    fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=3, figsize=(6, 3))\n\n    for ax, source in zip(axes, sources):\n        boundary.plot(ax=ax,                \n                      color='none',\n                      edgecolor='#362312')\n        subset = state_power_plants[state_power_plants['primsource'] == source]\n        subset.plot(ax=ax, markersize=5, alpha=0.5)\n        ax.set_title(source)\n        ax.axis('off')  # Remove axes for a cleaner look\n\n    plt.suptitle(f\"Top 3 energy sources for electric power plants in {state}\")\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    plt.show()\n\nWe can now use our functions to produce plots for any state:\n\nplot_3_energy_sources('New Jersey', \n                         top3_sources('New Jersey', power_plants),\n                         power_plants)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting functions can feel challenging at first, but with practice, they‚Äôll start to come naturally whenever you find yourself reusing blocks of code.

Work With Datetime Format in Python - Time Series Data [1].\n\n\n\nTo exemplify some of the basic time series functionalities we will use data about hourly precipitation in the county of Boulder, Colorado from 2000 to 2014. In September 2013, an unusual weather pattern led to some of the most intense precipitation ever recorded in this region, causing devastating floods throughout the Colorado Front Range. Our goal is to visualize precipitation data in 2013 and identify this unusual weather event.\n\n\n\nAerial view of floods during September 2013 in Colorado. Photo by State of Colorado.\n\n\nThis data was obtained via the National Oceanic and Atmosperic Administration (NOAA) Climate Data Online service and the resulting CSV that can be acceses at this link. The following is a a short description of the columns we will work with (the full documentation can be accessed here):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSTATION\nIdentification number indentifying the station.\n\n\nSTATION_NAME\nOptional field, name identifying the station location.\n\n\nDATE\nthis is the year of the record (4 digits), followed by month (2 digits), followed by day of the month (2 digits), followed by a space and ending with a time of observation that is a two digit indication of the local time hour, followed by a colon (:) followed by a two digit indication of the minute which for this dataset will always be 00. Note: The subsequent data value will be for the hour ending at the time specified here. Hour 00:00 will be listed as the first hour of each date, however since this data is by definition an accumulation of the previous 60 minutes, it actually occurred on the previous day.\n\n\nHPCP\nThe amount of precipitation recorded at the station for the hour ending at the time specified for DATE above given in inches. The values 999.99 means the data value is missing. Hours with no precipitation are not shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pandas library represents an instant in time using the pandas.Timestamp class. For example:\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create a timestamp\npd.Timestamp(year=2020, \n             month=10, \n             day=18, \n             hour=12, \n             minute=30, \n             second=15)\n\nTimestamp('2020-10-18 12:30:15')\n\n\nWhen we store multiple pandas.Timestamps in a pandas.Series the data type of the column is set to datetime64[ns]:\n\n# Notice the data type of the column is datetime64\npd.Series([pd.Timestamp(2020,10,18), \n           pd.Timestamp(2020,10,17),\n           pd.Timestamp(2020,10,16)])\n\n0   2020-10-18\n1   2020-10-17\n2   2020-10-16\ndtype: datetime64[ns]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs start by reading in the data and taking a look at it:\n\n# Read in data \nURL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carmengg/eds-220-book/main/data/boulder_colorado_2013_hourly_precipitation.csv'\nprecip = pd.read_csv(URL)\n\nprecip.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATION\nSTATION_NAME\nDATE\nHPCP\nMeasurement Flag\nQuality Flag\n\n\n\n\n0\nCOOP:055881\nNEDERLAND 5 NNW CO US\n20000101 00:00\n999.99\n]\n\n\n\n1\nCOOP:055881\nNEDERLAND 5 NNW CO US\n20000101 01:00\n0.00\ng\n\n\n\n2\nCOOP:055881\nNEDERLAND 5 NNW CO US\n20000102 20:00\n0.00\n\nq\n\n\n3\nCOOP:055881\nNEDERLAND 5 NNW CO US\n20000103 01:00\n0.00\n\nq\n\n\n4\nCOOP:055881\nNEDERLAND 5 NNW CO US\n20000103 05:00\n0.00\n\nq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot hourly precipitation in Boulder CO \nprecip.plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few things going on with this graph:\n\nOutliers: There are many jumps close to 1000. This is clearly not right and these are outliers. Looking at the column descriptions we can see 999.99 indicates the hourly precipitation data is missing.\nIndexing: The \\(x\\)-axis values are given by the index of the dataframe and not relative to time.\nTime range: We are only intersted in the precipitation data from 2013, this graph is trying to plot all our data.\n\nLet‚Äôs fix each one of these issues separately.\n\n\n\nThe metadata states the missing values are indicated by the number 999.99. We can use this information to reload the dataframe indicating 999.99 is the missing value. To do this, we add the na_values parameter to the pandas.read_csv() function to indicitate additional values that should be recognized as NA:\n\n# Read in CSV indicating NA values based on metadata\nprecip = pd.read_csv(URL, na_values=[999.99])\n\nprecip.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATION\nSTATION_NAME\nDATE\nHPCP\nMeasurement Flag\nQuality Flag\n\n\n\n\n0\nCOOP:055881\nNEDERLAND 5 NNW CO US\n20000101 00:00\nNaN\n]\n\n\n\n1\nCOOP:055881\nNEDERLAND 5 NNW CO US\n20000101 01:00\n0.0\ng\n\n\n\n2\nCOOP:055881\nNEDERLAND 5 NNW CO US\n20000102 20:00\n0.0\n\nq\n\n\n3\nCOOP:055881\nNEDERLAND 5 NNW CO US\n20000103 01:00\n0.0\n\nq\n\n\n4\nCOOP:055881\nNEDERLAND 5 NNW CO US\n20000103 05:00\n0.0\n\nq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the first hourly precipitation value used to be 999.99 and it is now set to a NaN. Check the na_values parameter in the pd.read_csv() documentation to learn more about which values are identified as NA by default.\nWe can try making our plot again:\n\nprecip.plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks better and we can already see there is something going on close to the end of the time series.\n\n\n\nNotice that the DATE column in our dataframe is not of type datetime. We can check this using the dtypes attribute for dataframes:\n\n# Check whether DATE column is of type datetime\nprecip.dtypes\n\nSTATION              object\nSTATION_NAME         object\nDATE                 object\nHPCP                float64\nMeasurement Flag     object\nQuality Flag         object\ndtype: object\n\n\n\nRemember that the object dtype means that (most likely) all values in that column are strings. We can easily convert strings to datetime objects using the pandas.to_datetime() function:\n\npandas.to_datetime() input: a pandas.Series with strings that can be converted to dates\npandas.to_datetime() output: a pandas.Series with the strings converted to datetime objects\n\n#### Example\n\n# Convert DATE column to timestamps\npd.to_datetime(precip.DATE)\n\n0

output:\n\n# Convert DATE column to timestamps\nprecip.DATE = pd.to_datetime(precip.DATE)\n\n# Check DATE column data type is updated\nprint(precip.dtypes)\n\n# Check new values\nprecip.DATE.head()\n\nSTATION                     object\nSTATION_NAME                object\nDATE                datetime64[ns]\nHPCP                       float64\nMeasurement Flag

dtype: datetime64[ns]\n\n\nWe can make another attempt at plotting our precipitation data:\n\nprecip.plot(x='DATE', y='HPCP')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the \\(x\\)-axis is now neatly organized into years.\nNext, using our DATE column as the index will allows to perform operations with respect to time, including subsetting and resampling.\n\n# Set DATE coumn as index\nprecip = precip.set_index('DATE')\n\n# Inspect new index\nprecip.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATION\nSTATION_NAME\nHPCP\nMeasurement Flag\nQuality Flag\n\n\nDATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2000-01-01

behaviour of plot() is to use the index as the \\(x\\)-axis and make a line plot for each numeric column, we can simplify our plot making like this:\n\nprecip.plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeverage pandas.read_csv() to set a known index\n\n\n\nIf we already have information about our data frame and know which column we will use as the index, we can directly set the index when we load the data by using:\ndf = pandas.read_csv(file, index_col=['index_column'])\nIf we also need our index to be of type datetime and we have a known dates column, then we can also create a datetime index directly when loading the data:\ndf = pandas.read_csv(file, index_col=['date_column'], parse_dates=['date_column'])\n\n\n\n\n\npandas has great

Notice we have a lot of gaps due to missing data:\n\nprecip.loc['2013'].plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResampling a time series means converting a time series from one frequency to another. For example, monthly to yearly (downsampling) or weekly to daily (upsampling). We can resample with the resample() method. The simplest use is to call\ndf.resample(new_frequency).aggregator_function()\nwhere: - new_frequency is a string representing the new frequence to resample the data, for example 'D' for day, w for week, M for month, Y for year, and - aggregator_function() is the function we will use to aggregate the data into the new frequency. For example, max(), min(), sum(), or average().\nThe resample() method works similarly to groupby() in the sense that you need to specify a way to aggregate the data to get any output.\n\n\nOur 2013 precipitation data has hourly frequency, we want to resample it to daily frequency.\n\n# Resample 2013 hourly data to daily frequency: no output\nprecip.loc['2013'].resample('D')\n\n&lt;pandas.core.resample.DatetimeIndexResampler object at 0x14b7c2990&gt;\n\n\nTo get an output we need to add an aggregator function that indicates how we want to summarize the data that falls on each day. In this case we want the total precipitation on a day, so we will aggreagate it using sum():\n\n# Total daily precipitation in 2013\ndaily_precip_2013 = precip.loc['2013'].resample('D').sum()\n\ndaily_precip_2013.head(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATION\nSTATION_NAME\nHPCP\nMeasurement Flag\nQuality Flag\n\n\nDATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013-01-01\nCOOP:050183COOP:055881COOP:050183COOP:055121CO...\nALLENSPARK 2 SE CO USNEDERLAND 5 NNW CO USALLE...\n0.0\n]g[gg\n\n\n\n2013-01-02\n0\n0\n0.0\n0\n0\n\n\n2013-01-03\n0\n0\n0.0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the index has now changed to be days in 2013. We should also rename the HPCP column since it is not longer hourly precipitation:\n\n# Rename hourly precipitation column to match resample\ndaily_precip_2013 = daily_precip_2013.rename(columns={'HPCP':'daily_precipitation'})\ndaily_precip_2013.columns\n\nIndex(['STATION', 'STATION_NAME', 'daily_precipitation', 'Measurement Flag',\n       'Quality Flag'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\nFinally, we can plot our data:\n\ndaily_precip_2013.plot(ylabel='daily precipitation (in)', \n                       xlabel=' ',\n                       title='Precipitation in Boulder, CO during 2013',\n                       legend=False)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe previous code includes a lot of exploratory functions and trials. While it is important to keep our data exploration documented, once we are certain of our data wrangling, we can streamline our analyses to only include the code that directly contributes to the output. Moving on, we will start to collect all our relevant code to create such complete workflows. For this lesson, the code below will produce the final graph:\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n'''\nRead in Boulder, CO hourly precipitation data \nHPCP = hourly precipitation (unique numerical column in data frame)\n'''\nURL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carmengg/eds-220-book/main/data/boulder_colorado_2013_hourly_precipitation.csv'\nprecip = pd.read_csv(URL, \n                    na_values=[999.99],  # Known from metadata\n                    index_col=['DATE'], \n                    parse_dates=['DATE']\n                    )\n\n\n# Calculate daily total precipitation during 2013\ndaily_precip_2013 = (precip.loc['2013']\n                            .resample('D')\n                            .sum()\n                            .rename(columns={'HPCP':'daily_precipitation'})  \n                            )\n\n# Plot time series\ndaily_precip_2013.plot(ylabel='daily precipitation (in)', \n                       xlabel=' ',\n                       title='Precipitation in Boulder, CO during 2013',\n                       legend=False)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is so much more to learn about time series data.

    "text": "Resampling a time series means converting a time series from one frequency to another. For example, monthly to yearly (downsampling) or weekly to daily (upsampling). We can resample with the resample() method. The simplest use is to call\ndf.resample(new_frequency).aggregator_function()\nwhere: - new_frequency is a string representing the new frequence to resample the data, for example 'D' for day, w for week, M for month, Y for year, and - aggregator_function() is the function we will use to aggregate the data into the new frequency. For example, max(), min(), sum(), or average().\nThe resample() method works similarly to groupby() in the sense that you need to specify a way to aggregate the data to get any output.\n\n\nOur 2013 precipitation data has hourly frequency, we want to resample it to daily frequency.\n\n# Resample 2013 hourly data to daily frequency: no output\nprecip.loc['2013'].resample('D')\n\n&lt;pandas.core.resample.DatetimeIndexResampler object at 0x14b7c2990&gt;\n\n\nTo get an output we need to add an aggregator function that indicates how we want to summarize the data that falls on each day. In this case we want the total precipitation on a day, so we will aggreagate it using sum():\n\n# Total daily precipitation in 2013\ndaily_precip_2013 = precip.loc['2013'].resample('D').sum()\n\ndaily_precip_2013.head(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATION\nSTATION_NAME\nHPCP\nMeasurement Flag\nQuality Flag\n\n\nDATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013-01-01\nCOOP:050183COOP:055881COOP:050183COOP:055121CO...\nALLENSPARK 2 SE CO USNEDERLAND 5 NNW CO USALLE...\n0.0\n]g[gg\n\n\n\n2013-01-02\n0\n0\n0.0\n0\n0\n\n\n2013-01-03\n0\n0\n0.0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the index has now changed to be days in 2013.

Don‚Äôt get caught up on ‚Äúwriting the perfect comments‚Äù! Start with correctly formatting your comments and thinking about their content and move on from there.\n\n\n\nComment should start with a pound sign # followed by a single space, then the text.\nThe first word in the comment should be capitalized [1].\nAlways use proper spelling.\nPeriods at the end of short comments are optional, but you should be consistent across your code.\n\n\n\nüö´ Typos, inconsistent capitalization, spacing, and punctuation\n#calculate teh average temp from dataset.\naverage_temp = sum(temperatures) / len(temperatures)\n\n    ##      Apply the TEMPERATURE correction\ncorrected_temp = average_temp + correction_factor\n‚úÖ Comments follow all the basic standards\n# Calculate average temperature from dataset\naverage_temp = sum(temperatures) / len(temperatures)\n\n# Apply temperature correction\ncorrected_temp = average_temp + correction_factor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs stated in the Python PEP 8 [1] guide:\n\nComments that contradict the code are worse than no comments.

Take some time too to learn about coding style and best practices, this resource by the UCSB Code Carpentries can help you!\n\n\nWhen we are learning to code, it can be super useful to comment on ‚Äòwhat‚Äô each line of code does. That‚Äôs ok! Over time, as you become more comfortable with the syntax, try to focus your comments on ‚Äòwhy‚Äô certain choices were made or when something might not be immediately obvious to others. Use comments to explain why a piece of code exists, what it‚Äôs doing at a high level, or to describe a complex algorithm. Great comments add value to the code, going beyond describing what is clear from the function and variable names.\nYour comments will become more streamlined and naturally shift from technical to conceptual as your coding skills improve!\n\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Comment restates in plain language what the code does\n# Assign the maximum value of the array to x\nx = find_max_value(array)  \n‚úÖ Comment explains the rationale behind the code\n# Find the largest value to normalize the data\nx = find_max_value(array)  \n\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs ok to err on over-commenting when you are beginning your coding journey. As you advance, focus on not over-commenting obvious code, as this can clutter your code and reduce readability.\n\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Redundant comments clutter the code\ntemperatures = [20.5, 21.0, 19.8, 22.3, 24.1]  # List of temperatures\n\n# Initialize total to 0\ntotal = 0  \n\n# Loop through each temperature in the list\nfor temp in temperatures:\n    total += temp  # Add the current temperature to the total\n\n# Calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of temperatures\naverage_temp = total / len(temperatures)\n\nprint(average_temp)  # Print the average temperature\n‚úÖ Comments focus on important information\ntemperatures = [20.5, 21.0, 19.8, 22.3, 24.1]\n\n# Calculate the total and average temperature\ntotal = 0\nfor temp in temperatures:\n    total += temp\n\naverage_temp = total / len(temperatures)\nprint(average_temp)\n\n\n\n\nThe phrase ‚Äúcode smells‚Äù refers to symptoms in our code that may indicate deeper problems with its design or structure. Sometimes comments are used to explain overly-complicated, instead of making the code as self-explanatory as possible. If that happens, then comments are being used as deodorant for smelly code [2]. Avoid comments as deodorant and, instead, work on making your code simple and understandable. Of course, you will learn better techniques to improve your code with time!\n\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Comments compensate for obscure variable names and overly-complicated code\n# List of pollutant concentrations (in ppm)\na = [50, 120, 85, 30, 95, 110, 70]  # 'a' stands for air quality measurements\n\n# Filter out pollutant readings that are greater than 100 ppm (considered outliers)\nb = []  # 'b' stands for valid pollutant readings\nfor x in a:  # 'x' is the individual pollutant reading\n    if x &lt;= 100: \n        b.append(x)  # Add valid readings to 'b'\n\nprint(b)\n‚úÖ Self-explanatory code needs less comments\n# List of pollutant concentrations (in ppm)\npollutant_readings = [50, 120, 85, 30, 95, 110, 70]\n\n# Filter out pollutant readings that are greater than 100 ppm (considered outliers)\nvalid_readings = [reading for reading in pollutant_readings if reading &lt;= 100]\n\nprint(valid_readings)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep it clean and consistent: Consistently use proper capitalization, spacing, spelling, and indentation.\nKeep comments up-to-date: Make sure your comments always match what the code is doing.\nBe clear and concise: Write concise comments. Keep them focused, and avoid adding personal notes or jokes. When possible, write comments that explain why your code is doing something, not just how.\nWrite clean code first: Focus on making your code clear and easy to understand. Use comments to make things even clearer, not to explain complicated or messy code.\nCommenting is a learning process! Don‚Äôt stress about writing ‚Äúperfect comments‚Äù. Focus on the basics, and let your commenting style evolve naturally as you improve your coding skills!\n\n\n\n\nHappy Commenting image created with Dall-E 4.",

    "text": "As you advance in your programming journey and code looks more familiar, you can take next steps to improve your code via comments. Take some time too to learn about coding style and best practices, this resource by the UCSB Code Carpentries can help you!\n\n\nWhen we are learning to code, it can be super useful to comment on ‚Äòwhat‚Äô each line of code does. That‚Äôs ok! Over time, as you become more comfortable with the syntax, try to focus your comments on ‚Äòwhy‚Äô certain choices were made or when something might not be immediately obvious to others. Use comments to explain why a piece of code exists, what it‚Äôs doing at a high level, or to describe a complex algorithm. Great comments add value to the code, going beyond describing what is clear from the function and variable names.\nYour comments will become more streamlined and naturally shift from technical to conceptual as your coding skills improve!\n\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Comment restates in plain language what the code does\n# Assign the maximum value of the array to x\nx = find_max_value(array)  \n‚úÖ Comment explains the rationale behind the code\n# Find the largest value to normalize the data\nx = find_max_value(array)  \n\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs ok to err on over-commenting when you are beginning your coding journey. As you advance, focus on not over-commenting obvious code, as this can clutter your code and reduce readability.\n\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Redundant comments clutter the code\ntemperatures = [20.5, 21.0, 19.8, 22.3, 24.1]  # List of temperatures\n\n# Initialize total to 0\ntotal = 0  \n\n# Loop through each temperature in the list\nfor temp in temperatures:\n    total += temp  # Add the current temperature to the total\n\n# Calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of temperatures\naverage_temp = total / len(temperatures)\n\nprint(average_temp)  # Print the average temperature\n‚úÖ Comments focus on important information\ntemperatures = [20.5, 21.0, 19.8, 22.3, 24.1]\n\n# Calculate the total and average temperature\ntotal = 0\nfor temp in temperatures:\n    total += temp\n\naverage_temp = total / len(temperatures)\nprint(average_temp)\n\n\n\n\nThe phrase ‚Äúcode smells‚Äù refers to symptoms in our code that may indicate deeper problems with its design or structure. Sometimes comments are used to explain overly-complicated, instead of making the code as self-explanatory as possible. If that happens, then comments are being used as deodorant for smelly code [2]. Avoid comments as deodorant and, instead, work on making your code simple and understandable. Of course, you will learn better techniques to improve your code with time!\n\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Comments compensate for obscure variable names and overly-complicated code\n# List of pollutant concentrations (in ppm)\na = [50, 120, 85, 30, 95, 110, 70]  # 'a' stands for air quality measurements\n\n# Filter out pollutant readings that are greater than 100 ppm (considered outliers)\nb = []  # 'b' stands for valid pollutant readings\nfor x in a:  # 'x' is the individual pollutant reading\n    if x &lt;= 100: \n        b.append(x)  # Add valid readings to 'b'\n\nprint(b)\n‚úÖ Self-explanatory code needs less comments\n# List of pollutant concentrations (in ppm)\npollutant_readings = [50, 120, 85, 30, 95, 110, 70]\n\n# Filter out pollutant readings that are greater than 100 ppm (considered outliers)\nvalid_readings = [reading for reading in pollutant_readings if reading &lt;= 100]\n\nprint(valid_readings)",

Keep them focused, and avoid adding personal notes or jokes. When possible, write comments that explain why your code is doing something, not just how.\nWrite clean code first: Focus on making your code clear and easy to understand. Use comments to make things even clearer, not to explain complicated or messy code.\nCommenting is a learning process! Don‚Äôt stress about writing ‚Äúperfect comments‚Äù.
