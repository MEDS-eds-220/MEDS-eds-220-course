    "text": "This hands-on lesson gives a brief introduction to Conda environments, focusing on practical usage. You can use this lesson as a standalone introduction to environments, ideally preceding the installation of the course-specific environment (see Setup section). The last section includes a table with the Conda commands used in this lesson for quick reference.\n\n\nBy the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n\nDescribe what Conda environments are and their role in managing Python packages and dependencies\nUse standard Conda commands to list, activate, deactivate, create, and delete environments\nBuild Conda environments and install packages using the command line\nGenerate and edit a .yml file with environment specifications to enhance project reproducibility\n\n\n\n\nEnvironments are a way to keep the packages and Python versions you use for different projects organized.\n\n\n\nSome environments can have lots of packages and dependencies, while others can keep it simple.\n\n\nThe main reasons to create an environment for each of your projects are:\n\nTo not interfere with your computer’s pre-installed Python\nPackages usually depend on other packages to work properly, this is called a package dependency. Dependencies across different packages need to be carefully managed and may potentially be different across projects.\nReproducibility! Being able to share your code and what it needs to run it with others\n\n\n\n\nConda is an environment and package management system: it can both create and administer the environments and install compatible versions of software and their dependencies within an environment.\nEnvironments created with Conda are usually called Conda environments. A Conda environment doesn’t need to be a Python environment, Conda can manage packages for any programming language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConda channels are the remote locations where packages are stored. Think of them as shops for getting packages. By default, packages are downloaded to your computer and updated from the conda default channel. But there are others! Conda-forge and bioconda are two popular ones. We can choose which Conda channel to install a package from.\n\n\n\npip is a package management system only for Python. We can use it to install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI). We can use pip inside a Conda environment when a package is not available from a Conda channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following exercises will guide you through the basic commands to work with Conda environments. Unless otherwise specified, all the commands should be run in the command line. For a deeper dive after completing this introduction, check out the Conda documentation.\n\n\nTo list all the Conda environments available in your computer and their location we use:\nconda env list\nThe output should look something like this:\n# conda environments:\n#\nbase                  *  /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3\neds220-env               /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/eds220-env\nNotice the file path next to the environment name. This is the absolute path to the environment’s installation directory on my local machine. This is where Conda has created the environment and stored the packages!\nWhat is my currently active environment?\n\nWhen you run conda env list, the asterisk next to the environment path indicates which environment is active. In the previous example, I am using the base Python environment.\nThe currently active environment also appears in the terminal in parenthesis at the beginning of each line, something like this:\n\n(base) my-computer:MEDS-eds-220-course galaz-garcia$\n\n\n\nTo create a new environment called test-env and, within it, install the most recent version of Python we simply run:\nconda create --name test-env python\nWhen you run this command, it will print out information about the packages that will be installed and ask you whether to proceed or not. Type y and press enter to create the environment and install the packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nCheck whether the new test-env environment is listed by Conda. Is it activated or not?\n\n\n\n\n\nTo activate the test-env environment we use the command\nconda activate test-env\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nVerify that test-env is now your current environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see which packages are installed within the currently active environment we run:\nconda list\nThe output will be a long list that looks something like this:\n# packages in environment at /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/test-env:\n#\n# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel\nbzip2                     1.0.8                h6c40b1e_6  \npip                       24.2            py312hecd8cb5_0  \nsqlite                    3.45.3               h6c40b1e_0  \n[...]\nThe name and version of each installed package in the environment appear in their respective columns. The ‘Build’ column shows a build string for each package. This string encodes important information about how the package was compiled, including any updates or changes made without altering the package version. It also reflects any compatibility or performance optimizations that were integrated during the build process.\nFor example, the same package with the same version might have different builds (and therefore different build strings) depending on whether it was installed on macOS, Windows, or Linux. This difference arises because the package may need to be compiled differently to optimize performance and ensure compatibility with each operating system.\nThe channel column shows the source from which the package was downloaded and installed. In this example the entries on this column are blank, signaling these packages were downloaded from the defeault Conda channel. We’ll see other channels appear in the next examples.\nWe can also request information about a specific package. For example, if we run\nconda list pip\nwe obtain only the information about the pip package:\n# packages in environment at /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/test-env:\n#\n# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel\npip                       24.2            py312hecd8cb5_0  \nWe can use the same command to verify whether a package is installed. For example, if we run\nconda list numpy\nwe will get empty columns:\n# packages in environment at /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/test-env:\n#\n# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel\nbecause the numpy package is not intalled in this environment.\n\n\n\nSuppose we want to install numpy in our currently active environment test-env. To do this we can simply use the command:\nconda install numpy\nSince we have not specified another channel, this command will install numpy from the default channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nVerify that numpy is now installed.\n\n\nNow, suppose we want to install rioxarray, this is a Python package for raster data analysis. This is a relatively new package, so it might not be available from the default Conda channels. A sensible measure would be to first look if rioxarray is available in the defaults channels, which we can do by running:\nconda search rioxarray\nThe output will look similar to\nLoading channels: done\nNo match found for: rioxarray. Search: *rioxarray*\n\nPackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:\n\n  - rioxarray\n\nCurrent channels:\n\n  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/osx-64\n  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/noarch\n  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/osx-64\n  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/noarch\n\nTo search for alternate channels that may provide the Conda package you're\nlooking for, navigate to\n\n    https://anaconda.org\n\nand use the search bar at the top of the page.\nAs stated, rioxarray is not available on the default channels for my Conda installation. Notice a couple of the channels it is seraching on are specific to macOS (my current operating system). The last two channels are actually channels for R packages. If we had tried to install rioxarray using conda install rioxarray we would have obtained an error message with similar information (you can try it if you want!).\nWe may have better luck searching for rioxarray in the conda-forge channel, which we can do like this:\nconda search --channel conda-forge rioxarray\nThe result will be a list of available versions and builds of this package in the conda-forge channel:\nLoading channels: done\n# Name                       Version           Build  Channel             \nrioxarray                      0.0.3            py_0  conda-forge         \nrioxarray                      0.0.4            py_0  conda-forge         \nrioxarray                      0.0.5            py_0  conda-forge     \n[...]\nrioxarray                     0.16.0    pyhd8ed1ab_0  conda-forge         \nrioxarray                     0.17.0    pyhd8ed1ab_0  conda-forge   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nDo you see any versions of rioxarray with multiple builds?\n\n\nSince we now know that we can find rioxarray in the conda-forge channel, we can go ahead and install it from this channel using the command\nconda install --channel conda-forge rioxarray\nYou’ll see a moving bar that says Conda is solving (the) environment - this is Conda doing its package management job! It means Conda is working on:\n\nfinding the dependencies for the packages you are trying to install,\nfinding versions of these dependencies that are compatible with each other,\nmaking sure these new packages are compatible with the packages already present in the environment,\ndowngrade, upgrade, or remove packages as needed in the environment.\n\nOverall, Conda tries to install what we need with the least disruption. Solving an environment can often take time but it is crucial so that the environment remains stable and functional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\n\nCheck whether pandas is installed in the environment.\nWhich channels were used to install dependencies for rioxarray?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo deactivate our current environment and return to our base environment we simply run\nconda deactivate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nVerify we are no longer in the test-env. What environment are we on?\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this was a test environment, we can go ahead and delete all of it using the command:\nconda remove --name test-env  --all\nIt will ask you whether you want to proceed. Type y and press enter to go ahead and delete the environment.\nWe can run conda env list to verify the test-env does not exist anymore.\n\n\n\nWe can also create a new environment by specifying the package versions and channel priorities. For example, to install the numpy and rioxarray versions we previously had in a new environment called my-env we run:\nconda create --name my-env rioxarray=0.17.0 numpy=1.26.4 --channel conda-forge\nNotice we are explicitely requiring certain versions of our packages, and the --channel conda-forge option is asking Conda to prioritize getting the packages from conda-forge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nTake a look at the dependencies that were installed with these two packages.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the main goals of using an environment to manage the packages used in your project is being able to share the environment so that other people can rerun your code and reproduce your results.\n“Sharing the environment” means sharing instructions that Conda can use to recreate the environment you have. These instructions are, basically, a list of the packages installed in the environment, their versions, which channels were used to install them, and, optionally, build specifications.\nThere are several ways of creating these instructions to reconstruct an environment depending on the level of cross-platform compatibility we are looking for. However, each of the following methods to export the environment specifications will generate a new YAML file. This file type with .yml extension is human-readable markup language that is commonly used for configuration in software applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to project directory\n\n\n\nEach of the commands for exporting the environment specifications will create a .yml file in our terminal’s current working directory. Remember you can use pwd (Mac & Linux) or echo %cd% (Windows CMD) on the command line to check which is your current working directory. If you need to change directories you can use cd navigation in the terminal.\nThe best practice is to have the environment.yml file in the directory that holds your project. This way, you can use version control on it and push it to your remote repository.\n\n\n\n\nThe first method to export the environment specifications is running\nconda env export &gt; environment.yml\nThe environment.yml is the name of the YAML file that will have the environment specifications.\nOpen the environment.yml file that was generated, it will look similar to this excerpt:\nname: my-env\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - affine=2.4.0=pyhd8ed1ab_0\n  - attrs=24.2.0=pyh71513ae_0\n  [...]\n  - zlib=1.3.1=h87427d6_1\n  - zstd=1.5.6=h915ae27_0\nprefix: /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/my-env\nHere we can see the name of the environment, the channels used to install packages (in order of priority), and the package names, each with a version and build string. This ensures that the environment can be recreated exactly as it is on another system. This first method to export the environment specifications is the most detailed and it is both platform and package specific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete prefix line before sharing environment\n\n\n\nNotice the last line in the environment.yml file, this prefix indicates the absolute path to the environment’s installation on your local machine.\nYou should delete the prefix line when sharing the environment file. Leaving it there is unnecessary and could cause confusion since it points to specific directroy in your local machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur second method to export the environment specifications is to run\nconda env export --from-history &gt; environment_hist.yml\nHere I named the file environment_hist.yml to not overwrite the previous environmnet.yml, that way you can compare both of them. Open the environment_hist.yml file, it will look similar to this (much shorter than the previous one):\nname: my-env\nchannels:\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - numpy=1.26.4\n  - rioxarray=0.17.0\nprefix: /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/my-env\nAdding the --from-history option tells Conda to only include packages that we explicitely installed (in this case numpy=1.26.4 and rioxarray=0.17.0), omitting any dependencies that were automatically installed and channel information. This will create a minimal environment file that lists only the packages you explicitly installed, making it simpler and more portable for sharing with others. While this method ensures reproducibility of the core setup, Conda will resolve dependencies on its own and these might not be the same as your original environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding channels to environment.yml file\n\n\n\nIn section 5 we saw that the rioxarray package is available on the conda-forge channel, but not the defaults channel. The output of conda env export with the --from-history option only includes the defaults channel, so we wouldn’t be able to recreate the environment with that file as is. Remember the .yml file can be manually modified and we can edit it to include conda-forge as the first priority channel, followed by the defaults channel. Rememember to also delete the prefix line before sharing. The modified version of the --from-history output that will allow us to recreate the environment will be:\nname: my-env\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - numpy=1.26.4\n  - rioxarray=0.17.0\n\n\nBefore moving to the last exercise, delete the environment.yml and environment_hist.yml files.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this last exercise, click here and download the environment.yml file in this repository. Move to a directory for a mock project and navigate to that directory in the terminal.\n\nTo create an environment from specifications in a .yml file we run\nconda env create --name test-env --file environment.yml\nThen --name option states how we want to name our environment (test-env in this case). If no --name option is given, Conda will name of the environment using the name field in the environment.yml file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nVerify that the new environment was created, activate it, and take a look at the installed packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following table includes the commands covered in this lesson’s exercises. Check out Conda’s cheatsheet for more commands and tips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nWhat it does\n\n\n\n\nconda env list\nlist available Conda environments\n\n\nconda create --name ENVNAME python\ncreate a new Python environment named ENVNAME\n\n\nconda remove --name ENVNAME  --all\ndelete ENVNAME environment\n\n\nconda activate ENVNAME\nactivate environment\n\n\nconda deactivate\ndeactivate active environment\n\n\npython -V\nprint Python version installed in active environment\n\n\nconda list\nlist installed packages in active environment\n\n\nconda list PKGNAME\ncheck if PKGNAME package is installed in active environment\n\n\nconda install PKGNAME\ninstall PKGNAME package in environment using environment channel priorities (generally just from defaults channel)\n\n\nconda install --channel CHANNELNAME PKGNAME\ninstall PKGNAME package in environment from from CHANNELNAME channel\n\n\nconda search PKGNAME\nsearch for PKGNAME package in environment’s channels\n\n\nconda search --channel CHANNELNAME PKGNAME\nsearch for PKGNAME package in CHANNELNAME channel\n\n\nconda env export &gt; ENV.yml\nexport environment specifications of currently active environmemt into ENV.yml file (includes all dependencies, buildstrings, and channels)\n\n\nconda env export --from-history &gt; ENV.yml\nexport environment specifications of currently active environmemt into ENV.yml file (only packages explicitely installed, no dependencies, buildstrings, or channels)\n\n\nconda env create --name ENVNAME --file ENV.yml\ncreate an environment named ENVNAME from specifications in ENV.yml file",

Is it activated or not?\n\n\n\n\n\nTo activate the test-env environment we use the command\nconda activate test-env\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nVerify that test-env is now your current environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see which packages are installed within the currently active environment we run:\nconda list\nThe output will be a long list that looks something like this:\n# packages in environment at /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/test-env:\n#\n# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel\nbzip2                     1.0.8                h6c40b1e_6  \npip                       24.2            py312hecd8cb5_0  \nsqlite                    3.45.3               h6c40b1e_0  \n[...]\nThe name and version of each installed package in the environment appear in their respective columns. The ‘Build’ column shows a build string for each package. This string encodes important information about how the package was compiled, including any updates or changes made without altering the package version. It also reflects any compatibility or performance optimizations that were integrated during the build process.\nFor example, the same package with the same version might have different builds (and therefore different build strings) depending on whether it was installed on macOS, Windows, or Linux. This difference arises because the package may need to be compiled differently to optimize performance and ensure compatibility with each operating system.\nThe channel column shows the source from which the package was downloaded and installed. In this example the entries on this column are blank, signaling these packages were downloaded from the defeault Conda channel. We’ll see other channels appear in the next examples.\nWe can also request information about a specific package. For example, if we run\nconda list pip\nwe obtain only the information about the pip package:\n# packages in environment at /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/test-env:\n#\n# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel\npip                       24.2            py312hecd8cb5_0  \nWe can use the same command to verify whether a package is installed. For example, if we run\nconda list numpy\nwe will get empty columns:\n# packages in environment at /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/test-env:\n#\n# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel\nbecause the numpy package is not intalled in this environment.\n\n\n\nSuppose we want to install numpy in our currently active environment test-env. To do this we can simply use the command:\nconda install numpy\nSince we have not specified another channel, this command will install numpy from the default channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nVerify that numpy is now installed.\n\n\nNow, suppose we want to install rioxarray, this is a Python package for raster data analysis. This is a relatively new package, so it might not be available from the default Conda channels. A sensible measure would be to first look if rioxarray is available in the defaults channels, which we can do by running:\nconda search rioxarray\nThe output will look similar to\nLoading channels: done\nNo match found for: rioxarray. Search: *rioxarray*\n\nPackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:\n\n  - rioxarray\n\nCurrent channels:\n\n  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/osx-64\n  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/noarch\n  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/osx-64\n  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/noarch\n\nTo search for alternate channels that may provide the Conda package you're\nlooking for, navigate to\n\n    https://anaconda.org\n\nand use the search bar at the top of the page.\nAs stated, rioxarray is not available on the default channels for my Conda installation. Notice a couple of the channels it is seraching on are specific to macOS (my current operating system). The last two channels are actually channels for R packages. If we had tried to install rioxarray using conda install rioxarray we would have obtained an error message with similar information (you can try it if you want!).\nWe may have better luck searching for rioxarray in the conda-forge channel, which we can do like this:\nconda search --channel conda-forge rioxarray\nThe result will be a list of available versions and builds of this package in the conda-forge channel:\nLoading channels: done\n# Name                       Version           Build  Channel             \nrioxarray                      0.0.3            py_0  conda-forge         \nrioxarray                      0.0.4            py_0  conda-forge         \nrioxarray                      0.0.5            py_0  conda-forge     \n[...]\nrioxarray                     0.16.0    pyhd8ed1ab_0  conda-forge         \nrioxarray                     0.17.0    pyhd8ed1ab_0  conda-forge   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nDo you see any versions of rioxarray with multiple builds?\n\n\nSince we now know that we can find rioxarray in the conda-forge channel, we can go ahead and install it from this channel using the command\nconda install --channel conda-forge rioxarray\nYou’ll see a moving bar that says Conda is solving (the) environment - this is Conda doing its package management job! It means Conda is working on:\n\nfinding the dependencies for the packages you are trying to install,\nfinding versions of these dependencies that are compatible with each other,\nmaking sure these new packages are compatible with the packages already present in the environment,\ndowngrade, upgrade, or remove packages as needed in the environment.\n\nOverall, Conda tries to install what we need with the least disruption. Solving an environment can often take time but it is crucial so that the environment remains stable and functional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\n\nCheck whether pandas is installed in the environment.\nWhich channels were used to install dependencies for rioxarray?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo deactivate our current environment and return to our base environment we simply run\nconda deactivate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nVerify we are no longer in the test-env. What environment are we on?\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this was a test environment, we can go ahead and delete all of it using the command:\nconda remove --name test-env  --all\nIt will ask you whether you want to proceed. Type y and press enter to go ahead and delete the environment.\nWe can run conda env list to verify the test-env does not exist anymore.\n\n\n\nWe can also create a new environment by specifying the package versions and channel priorities. For example, to install the numpy and rioxarray versions we previously had in a new environment called my-env we run:\nconda create --name my-env rioxarray=0.17.0 numpy=1.26.4 --channel conda-forge\nNotice we are explicitely requiring certain versions of our packages, and the --channel conda-forge option is asking Conda to prioritize getting the packages from conda-forge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nTake a look at the dependencies that were installed with these two packages.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the main goals of using an environment to manage the packages used in your project is being able to share the environment so that other people can rerun your code and reproduce your results.\n“Sharing the environment” means sharing instructions that Conda can use to recreate the environment you have. These instructions are, basically, a list of the packages installed in the environment, their versions, which channels were used to install them, and, optionally, build specifications.\nThere are several ways of creating these instructions to reconstruct an environment depending on the level of cross-platform compatibility we are looking for. However, each of the following methods to export the environment specifications will generate a new YAML file. This file type with .yml extension is human-readable markup language that is commonly used for configuration in software applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to project directory\n\n\n\nEach of the commands for exporting the environment specifications will create a .yml file in our terminal’s current working directory. Remember you can use pwd (Mac & Linux) or echo %cd% (Windows CMD) on the command line to check which is your current working directory. If you need to change directories you can use cd navigation in the terminal.\nThe best practice is to have the environment.yml file in the directory that holds your project. This way, you can use version control on it and push it to your remote repository.\n\n\n\n\nThe first method to export the environment specifications is running\nconda env export &gt; environment.yml\nThe environment.yml is the name of the YAML file that will have the environment specifications.\nOpen the environment.yml file that was generated, it will look similar to this excerpt:\nname: my-env\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - affine=2.4.0=pyhd8ed1ab_0\n  - attrs=24.2.0=pyh71513ae_0\n  [...]\n  - zlib=1.3.1=h87427d6_1\n  - zstd=1.5.6=h915ae27_0\nprefix: /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/my-env\nHere we can see the name of the environment, the channels used to install packages (in order of priority), and the package names, each with a version and build string. This ensures that the environment can be recreated exactly as it is on another system. This first method to export the environment specifications is the most detailed and it is both platform and package specific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete prefix line before sharing environment\n\n\n\nNotice the last line in the environment.yml file, this prefix indicates the absolute path to the environment’s installation on your local machine.\nYou should delete the prefix line when sharing the environment file. Leaving it there is unnecessary and could cause confusion since it points to specific directroy in your local machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur second method to export the environment specifications is to run\nconda env export --from-history &gt; environment_hist.yml\nHere I named the file environment_hist.yml to not overwrite the previous environmnet.yml, that way you can compare both of them. Open the environment_hist.yml file, it will look similar to this (much shorter than the previous one):\nname: my-env\nchannels:\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - numpy=1.26.4\n  - rioxarray=0.17.0\nprefix: /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/envs/my-env\nAdding the --from-history option tells Conda to only include packages that we explicitely installed (in this case numpy=1.26.4 and rioxarray=0.17.0), omitting any dependencies that were automatically installed and channel information. This will create a minimal environment file that lists only the packages you explicitly installed, making it simpler and more portable for sharing with others. While this method ensures reproducibility of the core setup, Conda will resolve dependencies on its own and these might not be the same as your original environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding channels to environment.yml file\n\n\n\nIn section 5 we saw that the rioxarray package is available on the conda-forge channel, but not the defaults channel. The output of conda env export with the --from-history option only includes the defaults channel, so we wouldn’t be able to recreate the environment with that file as is. Remember the .yml file can be manually modified and we can edit it to include conda-forge as the first priority channel, followed by the defaults channel. Rememember to also delete the prefix line before sharing. The modified version of the --from-history output that will allow us to recreate the environment will be:\nname: my-env\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - numpy=1.26.4\n  - rioxarray=0.17.0\n\n\nBefore moving to the last exercise, delete the environment.yml and environment_hist.yml files.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this last exercise, click here and download the environment.yml file in this repository. Move to a directory for a mock project and navigate to that directory in the terminal.\n\nTo create an environment from specifications in a .yml file we run\nconda env create --name test-env --file environment.yml\nThen --name option states how we want to name our environment (test-env in this case). If no --name option is given, Conda will name of the environment using the name field in the environment.yml file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nVerify that the new environment was created, activate it, and take a look at the installed packages.",

It is built on top of NumPy and has become the core tool for doing data analysis in Python.\nThe standard abbreviation for pandas is pd. Here we will import it together with NumPy:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConvention: importing packages\n\n\n\nAlways import all your packages in a single cell at the top of you notebook! Following the PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code [3], each package or library import should be in a separate line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first core object of pandas is the series. A series is a one-dimensional array of indexed data.\n\n\n\nImage adapted from Introduction to GeoPandas.\n\n\nA pandas.Series having an index is the main difference between a pandas.Series and a NumPy array. Let’s see the difference:\n\n# a numpy array\narr = np.random.randn(4) # random values from std normal distribution\nprint(type(arr))\nprint(arr, \"\\n\")\n\n# a pandas series made from the previous array\ns = pd.Series(arr)\nprint(type(s))\nprint(s)\n\n&lt;class 'numpy.ndarray'&gt;\n[-0.19007242  0.74871208  0.16997246  0.59083012] \n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.series.Series'&gt;\n0   -0.190072\n1    0.748712\n2    0.169972\n3    0.590830\ndtype: float64\n\n\nNotice the index is printed as part of the pandas.Series while, although the np.array is indexable, the index is not part of this data structure. Printing the pandas.Series also shows the values and their data type.\n\n\n\nThe basic method to create a pandas.Series is to call\ns = pd.Series(data, index=index)\nThe data parameter can be:\n\na list or NumPy array,\na Python dictionary, or\na single number, boolean (True/False), or string.\n\nThe index parameter is optional, if we wish to include it, it must be a list of list of indices of the same length as data.\n\n\nLet’s create a pandas.Series from a NumPy array. To use this method we need to pass a NumPy array (or a list of objects that can be converted to NumPy types) as data. Here, we will also include the list [2023, 2024, 2025] to be used as an index:\n\n# a series from a numpy array \npd.Series(np.arange(3), index=[2023, 2024, 2025])\n\n2023    0\n2024    1\n2025    2\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we create a pandas.Series from a list of strings. Remember that the index parameter is optional. If we don’t include it, the default is to make the index equal to [0,...,len(data)-1]. For example:\n\n# a series from a list of strings with default index\npd.Series(['EDS 220', 'EDS 222', 'EDS 223', 'EDS 242'])\n\n0    EDS 220\n1    EDS 222\n2    EDS 223\n3    EDS 242\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that a dictionary is a set of key-value pairs. If we create a pandas.Series via a dictionary the keys will become the index and the values the corresponding data.\n\n# construct dictionary\nd = {'key_0':2, 'key_1':'3', 'key_2':5}\n\n# initialize series using a dictionary\npd.Series(d)\n\nkey_0    2\nkey_1    3\nkey_2    5\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndtype: object\n\n\n\nNotice that in this and the previous example the data type of the values in the series is object. This data type in pandas usually indicates that the series is made up of strings. However, we can see in this example that the object data type can also indicate a mix of strings and numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we only provide a single number, boolean, or string as the data for the series, we need to provide an index. The value will be repeated to match the length of the index. Here, we create a series from a single float number with an index given by a list of strings:\n\npd.Series(3.0, index = ['A', 'B', 'C'])\n\nA    3.0\nB    3.0\nC    3.0\ndtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArithmetic operations work on series and so most NumPy functions. For example:\n\n# define a series\ns = pd.Series([98,73,65],index=['Andrea', 'Beth', 'Carolina'])\n\n# divide each element in series by 10\nprint(s /10, '\\n')\n\n# take the exponential of each element in series\nprint(np.exp(s), '\\n')\n\n# original series is unchanged\nprint(s)\n\nAndrea      9.8\nBeth        7.3\nCarolina    6.5\ndtype: float64 \n\nAndrea      3.637971e+42\nBeth        5.052394e+31\nCarolina    1.694889e+28\ndtype: float64 \n\nAndrea      98\nBeth        73\nCarolina    65\ndtype: int64\n\n\nWe can also produce new pandas.Series with True/False values indicating whether the elements in a series satisfy a condition or not:\n\ns &gt; 70\n\nAndrea       True\nBeth         True\nCarolina    False\ndtype: bool\n\n\nThis kind of simple conditions on pandas.Series will be key when we are selecting data from data frames.\n\n\n\nIn pandas we can represent a missing, NULL, or NA value with the float value numpy.nan, which stands for “not a number”. Let’s construct a small series with some NA values represented this way:\n\n# series with NAs in it\ns = pd.Series([1, 2, np.nan, 4, np.nan])\ns\n\n0    1.0\n1    2.0\n2    NaN\n3    4.0\n4    NaN\ndtype: float64\n\n\nNotice the data type of the values it he series is still float64.\nThe hasnans attribute for a pandas.Series returns True if there are any NA values in it and false otherwise:\n\n# check if series has NAs\ns.hasnans\n\nTrue\n\n\nAfter detecting there are Na values, we might be intersted in knowing which elements in the series are NAs. We can do this using the isna method:\n\ns.isna()\n\n0    False\n1    False\n2     True\n3    False\n4     True\ndtype: bool\n\n\nThe ouput is a pandas.Series of boolean values indicating if an element in the row at the given index is np.nan (True = is NA) or not (False = not NA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\n\nThe integer number -999 is often used to represent missing values. Create a pandas.Series named s with four integer values, two of which are -999. The index of this series should be the the letters A through D.\n\n\n\nIn the pandas.Series documentation, look for the method mask(). Use this method to update the series s so that the -999 values are replaced by NA values. HINT: check the first example in the method’s documentation.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s much more to say about pandas.Series, but this is enough to get us going. At this point, we mainly want to know about pandas.Series because pandas.Series are the columns of a pandas.DataFrame.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pandas.DataFrame is the most used pandas object. It represents tabular data and we can think of it as a spreadhseet. Each column of a pandas.DataFrame is a pandas.Series.\n\n\n\nImage adapted from Introduction to GeoPandas.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many ways of creating a pandas.DataFrame. We present one simple one in this section.\nWe already mentioned each column of a pandas.DataFrame is a pandas.Series. In fact, the pandas.DataFrame is a dictionary of pandas.Series, with each column name being the key and the column values being the key’s value. Thus, we can create a pandas.DataFrame in this way:\n\n# initialize dictionary with columns' data \nd = {'col_name_1' : pd.Series(np.arange(3)),\n     'col_name_2' : pd.Series([3.1, 3.2, 3.3]),\n     }\n\n# create data frame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(d)\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncol_name_1\ncol_name_2\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n3.1\n\n\n1\n1\n3.2\n\n\n2\n2\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can change the index by changing the index attribute in the data frame:\n\n# change index\ndf.index = ['a','b','c']\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncol_name_1\ncol_name_2\n\n\n\n\na\n0\n3.1\n\n\nb\n1\n3.2\n\n\nc\n2\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nWe can access the data frame’s column names via the columns attribute. Update the column names to C1 and C2 by updating this attribute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJump to the week 1 discussion section to practice preliminary data exploration with a real world dataset. Then, continue with the next lesson on subsetting data frames.",

    "text": "The first core object of pandas is the series. A series is a one-dimensional array of indexed data.\n\n\n\nImage adapted from Introduction to GeoPandas.\n\n\nA pandas.Series having an index is the main difference between a pandas.Series and a NumPy array. Let’s see the difference:\n\n# a numpy array\narr = np.random.randn(4) # random values from std normal distribution\nprint(type(arr))\nprint(arr, \"\\n\")\n\n# a pandas series made from the previous array\ns = pd.Series(arr)\nprint(type(s))\nprint(s)\n\n&lt;class 'numpy.ndarray'&gt;\n[-0.19007242  0.74871208  0.16997246  0.59083012] \n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.series.Series'&gt;\n0   -0.190072\n1    0.748712\n2    0.169972\n3    0.590830\ndtype: float64\n\n\nNotice the index is printed as part of the pandas.Series while, although the np.array is indexable, the index is not part of this data structure. Printing the pandas.Series also shows the values and their data type.\n\n\n\nThe basic method to create a pandas.Series is to call\ns = pd.Series(data, index=index)\nThe data parameter can be:\n\na list or NumPy array,\na Python dictionary, or\na single number, boolean (True/False), or string.\n\nThe index parameter is optional, if we wish to include it, it must be a list of list of indices of the same length as data.\n\n\nLet’s create a pandas.Series from a NumPy array. To use this method we need to pass a NumPy array (or a list of objects that can be converted to NumPy types) as data. Here, we will also include the list [2023, 2024, 2025] to be used as an index:\n\n# a series from a numpy array \npd.Series(np.arange(3), index=[2023, 2024, 2025])\n\n2023    0\n2024    1\n2025    2\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we create a pandas.Series from a list of strings. Remember that the index parameter is optional. If we don’t include it, the default is to make the index equal to [0,...,len(data)-1]. For example:\n\n# a series from a list of strings with default index\npd.Series(['EDS 220', 'EDS 222', 'EDS 223', 'EDS 242'])\n\n0    EDS 220\n1    EDS 222\n2    EDS 223\n3    EDS 242\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that a dictionary is a set of key-value pairs. If we create a pandas.Series via a dictionary the keys will become the index and the values the corresponding data.\n\n# construct dictionary\nd = {'key_0':2, 'key_1':'3', 'key_2':5}\n\n# initialize series using a dictionary\npd.Series(d)\n\nkey_0    2\nkey_1    3\nkey_2    5\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndtype: object\n\n\n\nNotice that in this and the previous example the data type of the values in the series is object. This data type in pandas usually indicates that the series is made up of strings. However, we can see in this example that the object data type can also indicate a mix of strings and numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we only provide a single number, boolean, or string as the data for the series, we need to provide an index. The value will be repeated to match the length of the index. Here, we create a series from a single float number with an index given by a list of strings:\n\npd.Series(3.0, index = ['A', 'B', 'C'])\n\nA    3.0\nB    3.0\nC    3.0\ndtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArithmetic operations work on series and so most NumPy functions. For example:\n\n# define a series\ns = pd.Series([98,73,65],index=['Andrea', 'Beth', 'Carolina'])\n\n# divide each element in series by 10\nprint(s /10, '\\n')\n\n# take the exponential of each element in series\nprint(np.exp(s), '\\n')\n\n# original series is unchanged\nprint(s)\n\nAndrea      9.8\nBeth        7.3\nCarolina    6.5\ndtype: float64 \n\nAndrea      3.637971e+42\nBeth        5.052394e+31\nCarolina    1.694889e+28\ndtype: float64 \n\nAndrea      98\nBeth        73\nCarolina    65\ndtype: int64\n\n\nWe can also produce new pandas.Series with True/False values indicating whether the elements in a series satisfy a condition or not:\n\ns &gt; 70\n\nAndrea       True\nBeth         True\nCarolina    False\ndtype: bool\n\n\nThis kind of simple conditions on pandas.Series will be key when we are selecting data from data frames.\n\n\n\nIn pandas we can represent a missing, NULL, or NA value with the float value numpy.nan, which stands for “not a number”. Let’s construct a small series with some NA values represented this way:\n\n# series with NAs in it\ns = pd.Series([1, 2, np.nan, 4, np.nan])\ns\n\n0    1.0\n1    2.0\n2    NaN\n3    4.0\n4    NaN\ndtype: float64\n\n\nNotice the data type of the values it he series is still float64.\nThe hasnans attribute for a pandas.Series returns True if there are any NA values in it and false otherwise:\n\n# check if series has NAs\ns.hasnans\n\nTrue\n\n\nAfter detecting there are Na values, we might be intersted in knowing which elements in the series are NAs. We can do this using the isna method:\n\ns.isna()\n\n0    False\n1    False\n2     True\n3    False\n4     True\ndtype: bool\n\n\nThe ouput is a pandas.Series of boolean values indicating if an element in the row at the given index is np.nan (True = is NA) or not (False = not NA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\n\nThe integer number -999 is often used to represent missing values. Create a pandas.Series named s with four integer values, two of which are -999. The index of this series should be the the letters A through D.\n\n\n\nIn the pandas.Series documentation, look for the method mask(). Use this method to update the series s so that the -999 values are replaced by NA values. HINT: check the first example in the method’s documentation.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s much more to say about pandas.Series, but this is enough to get us going. At this point, we mainly want to know about pandas.Series because pandas.Series are the columns of a pandas.DataFrame.",

We present one simple one in this section.\nWe already mentioned each column of a pandas.DataFrame is a pandas.Series. In fact, the pandas.DataFrame is a dictionary of pandas.Series, with each column name being the key and the column values being the key’s value. Thus, we can create a pandas.DataFrame in this way:\n\n# initialize dictionary with columns' data \nd = {'col_name_1' : pd.Series(np.arange(3)),\n     'col_name_2' : pd.Series([3.1, 3.2, 3.3]),\n     }\n\n# create data frame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(d)\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncol_name_1\ncol_name_2\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n3.1\n\n\n1\n1\n3.2\n\n\n2\n2\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can change the index by changing the index attribute in the data frame:\n\n# change index\ndf.index = ['a','b','c']\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncol_name_1\ncol_name_2\n\n\n\n\na\n0\n3.1\n\n\nb\n1\n3.2\n\n\nc\n2\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nWe can access the data frame’s column names via the columns attribute.

To copy the URL:\n\n\nhover over the Download button –&gt; right click –&gt; “Copy Link”.\n\n\nRead in the data from the URL using the pd.read_csv() function like this:\n# look at metadata\npd.read_csv('the URL goes here')\nTake a minute to look at the descriptions for the columns.\n\nNote: Not all datasets have column descriptions in a csv file. Often they come with a doc or txt file with information."

Like it’s often the case when working with the pandas package, there are many ways in which we can subset a data frame. Here we will review the core methods to do this.\nA summary of the methods covered in this lesson can be found in Figure 1.\n\n\nBy the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n\nChoose appropriate methods for selecting rows and columns from a pandas.DataFrame\nConstruct conditions to subset rows\nDescribe the difference between label-based subsetting and position-based subsetting\nApply best practies when using iloc and loc selection\n\n\n\n\nIn this lesson we will use annual estimates of bird species abundance in four coastal wetlands along the California coast. This dataset was derived for education purposes from the UCSB SONGS Mitigation Monitoring: Wetland Performance Standard - Bird Abundance and Species Richness dataset [1]. The SONGS dataset was collected as part of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) San Dieguito Wetland Restoration monitoring program.\n\n\n\nSan Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in San Diego County, California.

The values from the second column to the last column correspond to the number of different bird species recorded across the survey sites in each wetland during winter, spring, and fall of a given year. For example, the CSM_fall column has the number of species recorded in fall at Carpinteria Salt Marsh across years. The year column corresponds to the calendar year on which the data was collected.

It’s widely used in environmental science for sharing datasets like species counts and environmental monitoring data because it’s easy to create, read, and process in different platforms, without the need of proprietary software.\nTo read in a CSV file into our Python workspace as pandas.DataFrame we use the pandas.read_csv function:\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in file, argument is the file path\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/wetlands_seasonal_bird_diversity.csv')\n\nNext, we obtain some high-level information about this data frame:\n\n# Print data frame's first five rows \ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nCSM_winter\nCSM_spring\nCSM_fall\nMUL_winter\nMUL_spring\nMUL_fall\nSDW_winter\nSDW_spring\nSDW_fall\nTJE_winter\nTJE_spring\nTJE_fall\n\n\n\n\n0\n2010\n39.0\n40.0\n50.0\n45.0\nNaN\n61.0\nNaN\n75.0\n85.0\nNaN\nNaN\n81.0\n\n\n1\n2011\n48.0\n44.0\nNaN\n58.0\n52.0\nNaN\n78.0\n74.0\nNaN\n67.0\n70.0\nNaN\n\n\n2\n2012\n51.0\n43.0\n49.0\n57.0\n58.0\n53.0\n71.0\n72.0\n73.0\n70.0\n63.0\n69.0\n\n\n3\n2013\n42.0\n46.0\n38.0\n60.0\n58.0\n62.0\n69.0\n70.0\n70.0\n69.0\n74.0\n64.0\n\n\n4\n2014\n38.0\n43.0\n45.0\n49.0\n52.0\n57.0\n61.0\n78.0\n71.0\n60.0\n81.0\n62.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Print data frame's last five rows \ndf.tail()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nCSM_winter\nCSM_spring\nCSM_fall\nMUL_winter\nMUL_spring\nMUL_fall\nSDW_winter\nSDW_spring\nSDW_fall\nTJE_winter\nTJE_spring\nTJE_fall\n\n\n\n\n9\n2019\n39.0\n39.0\n40.0\n57.0\n52.0\n53.0\n54.0\n55.0\n53.0\n63.0\n54.0\n50.0\n\n\n10\n2020\n46.0\nNaN\n47.0\n56.0\nNaN\n66.0\n57.0\nNaN\n58.0\n54.0\n40.0\n54.0\n\n\n11\n2021\n47.0\n44.0\n53.0\n54.0\n55.0\n60.0\n57.0\n58.0\n57.0\n53.0\n68.0\n51.0\n\n\n12\n2022\n40.0\n46.0\n49.0\n60.0\n55.0\n65.0\n57.0\n60.0\n57.0\n60.0\n61.0\n60.0\n\n\n13\n2023\n56.0\n43.0\n36.0\n72.0\n59.0\n53.0\n64.0\n63.0\n33.0\n60.0\n56.0\n38.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Print data frame's column names\ndf.columns\n\nIndex(['year', 'CSM_winter', 'CSM_spring', 'CSM_fall', 'MUL_winter',\n       'MUL_spring', 'MUL_fall', 'SDW_winter', 'SDW_spring', 'SDW_fall',\n       'TJE_winter', 'TJE_spring', 'TJE_fall'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\n\n# List the data types of each column\ndf.dtypes\n\nyear            int64\nCSM_winter    float64\nCSM_spring    float64\nCSM_fall      float64\nMUL_winter    float64\nMUL_spring    float64\nMUL_fall      float64\nSDW_winter    float64\nSDW_spring    float64\nSDW_fall      float64\nTJE_winter    float64\nTJE_spring    float64\nTJE_fall      float64\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n# Print data frame's shape: output is a tuple (# rows, # columns)\ndf.shape\n\n(14, 13)\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting a single column by column name is the simplest case for selecting data in a data frame. The genereal syntax to do this is:\ndf['column_name']\nNotice the column name is given as string inside the square brackets. This is an example of label-based subsetting, which means we want to select data from our data frame using the names of the columns, not their position. When we select rows or column using their position, we are doing position-based subsetting. We’ll see some methods to do this when we move into selecting rows.\n\n\nSuppose we are interested in the number of bird species observed at the Mugu Lagoon in spring. We can access that single column in this way:\n\n# Select a single column by using square brackets []\nmul_spring = df['MUL_spring']\n\n# Print first five elements in this column\nmul_spring.head()\n\n0     NaN\n1    52.0\n2    58.0\n3    58.0\n4    52.0\nName: MUL_spring, dtype: float64\n\n\nSince we only selected a single column, mul_spring is a pandas.Series:\n\n# Check the type of the ouput\nprint(type(mul_spring))\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.series.Series'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npd.DataFrame = dictionary of columns\n\n\n\nRemember we can think of a pandas.DataFrame as a dictionary of its columns? Then we can access a single column using the column name as the key, just like we would do in a dictionary. That is the we just used: df['column_name'].\n\n\nWe can also do label-based subsetting of a single column using attribute syntax:\ndf.column_name\nFor example, to see the head of the MUL_spring column we would do:\n\ndf.MUL_spring.head()\n\n0     NaN\n1    52.0\n2    58.0\n3    58.0\n4    52.0\nName: MUL_spring, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavor df['column_name'] instead of df.column_name\n\n\n\nIn general, it is better to use the df['column_name'] syntax. A couple reasons why are:\n\ndf['column_name'] can take in any column name, while df.column_name only works if the column name has no spaces or special characters\ndf['column_name'] avoids conflicts with pd.DataFrame methods and attributes. For example, if df has a column named count, it’s ambiguous whehter pd.count is referring to the count() method or the count column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can select multiple columns in a single call by passing a list with the column names to the square brackets []:\ndf[['column_1', 'column_10', 'column_245']]\nNotice there are double square brackets. This is because we are passing the list of names ['column_1', 'column_10', 'column_245'] to the selection brakcets [].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nIs this an example of label-based selection or location-based selection?\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to look at the species in the Tijuana Estuary during winter and fall, then we can select these columns like this:\n\n# select columns with names \"europe\" and \"asia\"\ntje_wf = df[['TJE_winter','TJE_fall']]\n\nNotice there are double square brackets. This is because we are passing the list of names ['europe','asia'] to the selection brakcets [].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nWhat is the type and shape of the tje_wf output? Verify your answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo select a slice of the columns we will use a special case of loc selection (we’ll cover the general one by the end of the lesson). The syntax will be\ndf.loc[ : , 'column_start':'column_end']\nwhere column_start and column_end are, respectively, the starting point and endpoint of the column slice we want to subset from the data frame.\nNotice two things:\n\nthe first value passed to loc is used for selecting rows, using a colon : as the row-selection parameter means “select all the rows”\nthe slice of the data frame we’ll obtain includes both endpoints of the slice 'column_start':'column_end'. In other words, we’ll get the column_start column and the column_end column. This is different from how slicing works in base Python and NumPy, where the endpoint is not included.\n\n\n\nLet’s select the slice of columns that covers all data from Carpinteria Salt Marsh and Mugu Lagoon. This corresponds to all columns between CSM_winter and MUL_fall.\n\n# Select columns between 'CSM_winter' and 'MUL_fall'\ncsm_mul = df.loc[:,'CSM_winter':'MUL_fall']\ncsm_mul.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSM_winter\nCSM_spring\nCSM_fall\nMUL_winter\nMUL_spring\nMUL_fall\n\n\n\n\n0\n39.0\n40.0\n50.0\n45.0\nNaN\n61.0\n\n\n1\n48.0\n44.0\nNaN\n58.0\n52.0\nNaN\n\n\n2\n51.0\n43.0\n49.0\n57.0\n58.0\n53.0\n\n\n3\n42.0\n46.0\n38.0\n60.0\n58.0\n62.0\n\n\n4\n38.0\n43.0\n45.0\n49.0\n52.0\n57.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfall_columns = df.filter(like=‘fall’)\n\n\n\n\nNow that we are familiar with some methods for selecting columns, let’s move on to selecting rows.\n\n\nSelecting rows that satisfy a particular condition is one of the most usual kinds of row subsetting. The general syntax for this type of selection is\ndf[condition_on_rows]\nThat condition_of_rows can be a myriad things, let’s see some usual scenarios.\n\n\nSuppose we are intersted in all data after 2020. We can select these rows in this way:\n\n# Select all rows with year &gt; 2020\npost_2020 = df[df['year']&gt;2020]\npost_2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nCSM_winter\nCSM_spring\nCSM_fall\nMUL_winter\nMUL_spring\nMUL_fall\nSDW_winter\nSDW_spring\nSDW_fall\nTJE_winter\nTJE_spring\nTJE_fall\n\n\n\n\n11\n2021\n47.0\n44.0\n53.0\n54.0\n55.0\n60.0\n57.0\n58.0\n57.0\n53.0\n68.0\n51.0\n\n\n12\n2022\n40.0\n46.0\n49.0\n60.0\n55.0\n65.0\n57.0\n60.0\n57.0\n60.0\n61.0\n60.0\n\n\n13\n2023\n56.0\n43.0\n36.0\n72.0\n59.0\n53.0\n64.0\n63.0\n33.0\n60.0\n56.0\n38.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s break down what is happening here. The condition for our rows is df['year']&gt;2020, this is a pandas.Series with boolean values (True or False) indicating which rows satisfy the condition year&gt;2020:\n\n# Check the type of df['year']&gt;1996\nprint(type(df['year']&gt;2020))\n\n# Print the boolean series\ndf['year']&gt;2020\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.series.Series'&gt;\n\n\n0     False\n1     False\n2     False\n3     False\n4     False\n5     False\n6     False\n7     False\n8     False\n9     False\n10    False\n11     True\n12     True\n13     True\nName: year, dtype: bool\n\n\nWhen we pass such a series of boolean values to the selection brackets [] we keep only the rows that correspond to a True value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nGet the subset of our data frame on which the San Dieguito Wetland has at least 75 species recorded during spring.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we want to look at data from years 2012 to 2015 (including both years). One way of doing this is to use the between operator in our condition:\n\nsubset = df[df['year'].between(2012, 2015)]\nsubset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nCSM_winter\nCSM_spring\nCSM_fall\nMUL_winter\nMUL_spring\nMUL_fall\nSDW_winter\nSDW_spring\nSDW_fall\nTJE_winter\nTJE_spring\nTJE_fall\n\n\n\n\n2\n2012\n51.0\n43.0\n49.0\n57.0\n58.0\n53.0\n71.0\n72.0\n73.0\n70.0\n63.0\n69.0\n\n\n3\n2013\n42.0\n46.0\n38.0\n60.0\n58.0\n62.0\n69.0\n70.0\n70.0\n69.0\n74.0\n64.0\n\n\n4\n2014\n38.0\n43.0\n45.0\n49.0\n52.0\n57.0\n61.0\n78.0\n71.0\n60.0\n81.0\n62.0\n\n\n5\n2015\n44.0\n42.0\n45.0\n58.0\n50.0\n51.0\n71.0\n61.0\n65.0\n73.0\n76.0\n64.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s break down this code:\n\ndf['year'] is the column with the year values, a pandas.Series\nin df['year'].between(), we have that between is a method for the pandas.Series and we are calling it using the dot .\n(2012, 2015) are the parameters for the between() method, from the pandas documentation we can see this method will subset including both endpoints\ndf['year'].between(2012, 2015) is then a pandas.Series of boolean values indicating which rows have year equal to 2012, 2013, 2014, or 2015.\nwhen we put df['year'].between(2012, 2015) inside the selection brackets [] we obtain the rows of the data frame with year equal to 2012, …, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid using loc for selecting only rows\n\n\n\nIt is equivalent to write\n# Select rows with year&lt;2015\ndf[df['year'] &lt; 2015]\nand\n# Select rows with year&lt;2015 using loc\ndf.loc[ df['year'] &lt;2015 , :]\nIn the second one:\n\nwe are using the df.loc[ row-selection , column-selection] syntax\nthe row-selection parameter is the condition df['year']&lt;2015\nthe column-selection parameter is a colon :, which indicates we want all columns for the rows we are selecting.\n\nWe prefer the first syntax when we are selecting rows and not columns since it is simpler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can combine multipe conditions to select rows by surrounding each one in parenthesis () and using the or operator | and the and operator &.\n\n\nLet’s select rows in which the Carpinteria Salt Marsh has more than 50 registered in winter or fall:\n\ndf[ (df['CSM_winter']&gt;50) | (df['CSM_fall']&gt;50)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nCSM_winter\nCSM_spring\nCSM_fall\nMUL_winter\nMUL_spring\nMUL_fall\nSDW_winter\nSDW_spring\nSDW_fall\nTJE_winter\nTJE_spring\nTJE_fall\n\n\n\n\n2\n2012\n51.0\n43.0\n49.0\n57.0\n58.0\n53.0\n71.0\n72.0\n73.0\n70.0\n63.0\n69.0\n\n\n11\n2021\n47.0\n44.0\n53.0\n54.0\n55.0\n60.0\n57.0\n58.0\n57.0\n53.0\n68.0\n51.0\n\n\n13\n2023\n56.0\n43.0\n36.0\n72.0\n59.0\n53.0\n64.0\n63.0\n33.0\n60.0\n56.0\n38.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s select rows with in which both the Carpinteria Salt Marsh and the San Dieguito Wetland have more than 60 reported bird species during spring:\n\ndf[ (df['CSM_spring']&gt;60) & (df['SDW_spring']&gt;60)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nCSM_winter\nCSM_spring\nCSM_fall\nMUL_winter\nMUL_spring\nMUL_fall\nSDW_winter\nSDW_spring\nSDW_fall\nTJE_winter\nTJE_spring\nTJE_fall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn empty data frame! That’s ok, it just means there are no rows that satisfy the given condition.\n\n\n\n\nAll the selections we have done so far have been using labels. Sometimes we may want to select certain rows depending on their actual position in the data frame in other words, using position-based subsetting. To do this, we use iloc selection with the syntax\n df.iloc[row-indices]\niloc stands for integer-location based indexing.\n\n\n\n# Select the fifth row (index=4)\ndf.iloc[4]\n\nyear          2014.0\nCSM_winter      38.0\nCSM_spring      43.0\nCSM_fall        45.0\nMUL_winter      49.0\nMUL_spring      52.0\nMUL_fall        57.0\nSDW_winter      61.0\nSDW_spring      78.0\nSDW_fall        71.0\nTJE_winter      60.0\nTJE_spring      81.0\nTJE_fall        62.0\nName: 4, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n# Select rows 9 through 13, inclduing 13\ndf.iloc[9:14]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nCSM_winter\nCSM_spring\nCSM_fall\nMUL_winter\nMUL_spring\nMUL_fall\nSDW_winter\nSDW_spring\nSDW_fall\nTJE_winter\nTJE_spring\nTJE_fall\n\n\n\n\n9\n2019\n39.0\n39.0\n40.0\n57.0\n52.0\n53.0\n54.0\n55.0\n53.0\n63.0\n54.0\n50.0\n\n\n10\n2020\n46.0\nNaN\n47.0\n56.0\nNaN\n66.0\n57.0\nNaN\n58.0\n54.0\n40.0\n54.0\n\n\n11\n2021\n47.0\n44.0\n53.0\n54.0\n55.0\n60.0\n57.0\n58.0\n57.0\n53.0\n68.0\n51.0\n\n\n12\n2022\n40.0\n46.0\n49.0\n60.0\n55.0\n65.0\n57.0\n60.0\n57.0\n60.0\n61.0\n60.0\n\n\n13\n2023\n56.0\n43.0\n36.0\n72.0\n59.0\n53.0\n64.0\n63.0\n33.0\n60.0\n56.0\n38.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that, since we are back to indexing by position, the right endpoint of the slice is not included in the ouput.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting rows and columns simultaneously can be done using loc (labels) or iloc (positions).\n\n\nWhen we want to select rows and columns simultaneously by labels (including using conditions) we can use loc selection with the syntax\ndf.loc[ row-selection , column-selection]\nspecifying both paratmers: row-selection and column-selection. These parameters can be a condition or a subset of labels from the index or the column names.\n\n\nLet’s select the winter surveys for Mugu Lagoon and the Tijuana Estuary after 2020:\n\ndf.loc[df['year']&gt;2020, ['MUL_winter','TJE_winter']]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMUL_winter\nTJE_winter\n\n\n\n\n11\n54.0\n53.0\n\n\n12\n60.0\n60.0\n\n\n13\n72.0\n60.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s break down this code:\n\nwe are using the df.loc[ row-selection , column-selection] syntax\nthe row-selection parameter is the condition df['year']&gt;2020, which is a boolean array saying which years are greater than 2020\nthe column-selection parameter is ['MUL_winter','TJE_winter'] which is a list with the names of the two columns we are interested in.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we want to select rows and columns simultaneously by position we use iloc selection with the syntax:\ndf.iloc[ row-indices , column-indices]\n\n\nSuppose we want to select rows 3-7 (including 7) and columns 3 and 4:\n\ndf.iloc[ 3:8, [3,4] ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSM_fall\nMUL_winter\n\n\n\n\n3\n38.0\n60.0\n\n\n4\n45.0\n49.0\n\n\n5\n45.0\n58.0\n\n\n6\n47.0\n63.0\n\n\n7\n43.0\n57.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\nwe are using the df.iloc[ row-indices , column-indices] syntax to select by position\nthe row-indices parameter is the slice of integer indices 3:8. Remember the right endpoint (8) won’t be included.\nthe column-indices parameter is the list of integer indices 3 and 4. This means we are selecting the fourth and fifth column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niloc vs. loc: which one does what?\n\n\n\nAt the beginning, the difference between iloc and loc can be confusing. Remember the i in iloc stands for integer location, this reminds us iloc only uses integer indexing to retrieve information from the data frames in the same way as indexing for Python lists.\nIf you want to dive deeper, this is a great discussion about the difference between iloc and loc: Stackoverflow - How are iloc and loc different?\nAnd, as always, the documentation will provide you with more information: pandas.DataFrame.loc and pandas.DataFrame.iloc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niloc for column selection? Avoid it!\n\n\n\nWe can also access columns by position using iloc - but it is best not to if possible.\nSuppose we want to access the 10th column in the data frame - then we want to select a column by position. In this case the 10th column is the annual sea level rise data and the 10th position corresponds to the index 9. We can select this column by position using the iloc selection:\n\n# select column by position using iloc\n# the syntax is iloc[row-indices, column-indices]\n# [:,9] means \"select all rows from the 10th column\"\nannual_rise_3 = df.iloc[:,9]\nannual_rise_3.head()\n\n0    85.0\n1     NaN\n2    73.0\n3    70.0\n4    71.0\nName: SDW_fall, dtype: float64\n\n\nUnless you are really looking for information about the 10th column, do not access a column by position. This is bound to break in many ways:\n\nit relies on a person correctly counting the position of a column. Even with a small dataset this can be prone to error.\nit is not explicit: if we want information about sea level rise df.annual_sea_level_rise or df['annual_sea_level_rise'] are explicitely telling us we are accessing that information. df.iloc[:,9] is obscure and uninformative.\ndatastets can get updated. Maybe a new column was added before annual_sea_level_rise, this would change the position of the column, which would make any code depending on df.iloc[:,9] invalid.\n\nAccessing columns by labels helps reproducibility!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Flow diagram for selecting core methods to subset a pandas.DataFrame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is presented in this section is a comprehensive, but not exhaustive list of methods to select data in pandas.DataFrames.

    "text": "Selecting a single column by column name is the simplest case for selecting data in a data frame. The genereal syntax to do this is:\ndf['column_name']\nNotice the column name is given as string inside the square brackets. This is an example of label-based subsetting, which means we want to select data from our data frame using the names of the columns, not their position. When we select rows or column using their position, we are doing position-based subsetting. We’ll see some methods to do this when we move into selecting rows.\n\n\nSuppose we are interested in the number of bird species observed at the Mugu Lagoon in spring. We can access that single column in this way:\n\n# Select a single column by using square brackets []\nmul_spring = df['MUL_spring']\n\n# Print first five elements in this column\nmul_spring.head()\n\n0     NaN\n1    52.0\n2    58.0\n3    58.0\n4    52.0\nName: MUL_spring, dtype: float64\n\n\nSince we only selected a single column, mul_spring is a pandas.Series:\n\n# Check the type of the ouput\nprint(type(mul_spring))\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.series.Series'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npd.DataFrame = dictionary of columns\n\n\n\nRemember we can think of a pandas.DataFrame as a dictionary of its columns? Then we can access a single column using the column name as the key, just like we would do in a dictionary. That is the we just used: df['column_name'].\n\n\nWe can also do label-based subsetting of a single column using attribute syntax:\ndf.column_name\nFor example, to see the head of the MUL_spring column we would do:\n\ndf.MUL_spring.head()\n\n0     NaN\n1    52.0\n2    58.0\n3    58.0\n4    52.0\nName: MUL_spring, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavor df['column_name'] instead of df.column_name\n\n\n\nIn general, it is better to use the df['column_name'] syntax. A couple reasons why are:\n\ndf['column_name'] can take in any column name, while df.column_name only works if the column name has no spaces or special characters\ndf['column_name'] avoids conflicts with pd.DataFrame methods and attributes. For example, if df has a column named count, it’s ambiguous whehter pd.count is referring to the count() method or the count column.",

Verify your answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo select a slice of the columns we will use a special case of loc selection (we’ll cover the general one by the end of the lesson). The syntax will be\ndf.loc[ : , 'column_start':'column_end']\nwhere column_start and column_end are, respectively, the starting point and endpoint of the column slice we want to subset from the data frame.\nNotice two things:\n\nthe first value passed to loc is used for selecting rows, using a colon : as the row-selection parameter means “select all the rows”\nthe slice of the data frame we’ll obtain includes both endpoints of the slice 'column_start':'column_end'. In other words, we’ll get the column_start column and the column_end column. This is different from how slicing works in base Python and NumPy, where the endpoint is not included.\n\n\n\nLet’s select the slice of columns that covers all data from Carpinteria Salt Marsh and Mugu Lagoon.

    "text": "iloc vs. loc: which one does what?\n\n\n\nAt the beginning, the difference between iloc and loc can be confusing. Remember the i in iloc stands for integer location, this reminds us iloc only uses integer indexing to retrieve information from the data frames in the same way as indexing for Python lists.\nIf you want to dive deeper, this is a great discussion about the difference between iloc and loc: Stackoverflow - How are iloc and loc different?\nAnd, as always, the documentation will provide you with more information: pandas.DataFrame.loc and pandas.DataFrame.iloc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niloc for column selection? Avoid it!\n\n\n\nWe can also access columns by position using iloc - but it is best not to if possible.\nSuppose we want to access the 10th column in the data frame - then we want to select a column by position. In this case the 10th column is the annual sea level rise data and the 10th position corresponds to the index 9. We can select this column by position using the iloc selection:\n\n# select column by position using iloc\n# the syntax is iloc[row-indices, column-indices]\n# [:,9] means \"select all rows from the 10th column\"\nannual_rise_3 = df.iloc[:,9]\nannual_rise_3.head()\n\n0    85.0\n1     NaN\n2    73.0\n3    70.0\n4    71.0\nName: SDW_fall, dtype: float64\n\n\nUnless you are really looking for information about the 10th column, do not access a column by position. This is bound to break in many ways:\n\nit relies on a person correctly counting the position of a column. Even with a small dataset this can be prone to error.\nit is not explicit: if we want information about sea level rise df.annual_sea_level_rise or df['annual_sea_level_rise'] are explicitely telling us we are accessing that information. df.iloc[:,9] is obscure and uninformative.\ndatastets can get updated. Maybe a new column was added before annual_sea_level_rise, this would change the position of the column, which would make any code depending on df.iloc[:,9] invalid.\n\nAccessing columns by labels helps reproducibility!",

    "text": "This is a short review about some core concepts in Python exemplified by objects in the NumPy library. The goal is to recall basic Python vocabulary that will be used throughout the course, rather than to serve as an introduction to Python programming.\n\n\nBy the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n\nDefine and provide examples for basic terms in Python programming like variable, object, function, class, attribute, and method.\nRecognize optional and non-optional arguments in a function.\nUnderstand some of the basic differences in R and Python syntax.\n\n\n\n\nA library is a collection of code that we can use to perform specific tasks in our programs. It can be a single file or multiple ones. NumPy [1] is one of the core libraries for numerical computing in Python. Many of the libraries we will use in this course use NumPy’s arrays as their building blocks. Additionally, NumPy objects have been optimized for processing, so computations on them are really fast and use less memory than doing the equivalent using the core Python data structures.\nIn this lesson we will use NumPy to review some fundamental concepts in Python you should be already familiar with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary or package?\n\n\n\nA package in Python refers to a specific way of organizing multiple files of code into a directory hierarcy, often within a large code library. The words “library” and “package” are often used interchangeably. NumPy, for example, is both a library and a package.\n\n\nLet’s start by importing the NumPy library by using the standard to abbreviation, np:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nBy importing numpy, all the objects and functions in this library will be available for us to use in our notebook.\n\n\n\nWe can think of a variable as a name we assign to a particular object in Python. For example:\n\n# assign a small array to variable a\na = np.array([[1,1,2],[3,5,8]])\n\nWhen we run the cell, we store the variables and their value. We can view a variable’s value in two ways from within our Jupyter notebook:\n\nrunning a cell with the variable name\nusing the print function to print the value\n\n\n# show the value\na\n\narray([[1, 1, 2],\n       [3, 5, 8]])\n\n\n\n# print the value \nprint(a)\n\n[[1 1 2]\n [3 5 8]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR and Python: assigning values\n\n\n\nRemember that in Python we use the equal sign = to assign values to variables in the same way the left-arrow &lt;- is used in R:\n# R: assign value 10 to variable a\na &lt;- 10\n# python: assign value 10 to variable a\na = 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConvention: Use snake_case for naming variables\n\n\n\nThere are many ways of constructing multi-word variable names. In this course we will name variables using snake_case, where words are all in small caps and separated by underscores (ex: raw_data, fires_2023). This is the naming convention suggested by the PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code [2]. Remember variable names should be both descriptive and concise!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will often encounter the word object in Python documentation and tutorials. Informally speaking, an object is a bundle of properties and actions about something specific. For example, an object could represent a data frame with properties such as number of rows, names of columns, and date created, and actions suchs as selecting a specific row or adding a new column.\nA variable is the name we give a specific object, and the same object can be referenced by different variables. An analogy for this is the following: the Sun (object) is called “sol” in Spanish and “soleil” in French, so two different names (variables) represent the same object. You can read more technical details about the difference between objects and variables in Python here [3].\nIn practice, we can often use the word variable and object interchangeably (for example, in the next subsection!). I want to bring up what objects are so you are not caught off-guard with vocabulary you will often encounter in the documentation, StackExchange, etc.\n\n\n\nEvery object in Python has a type, the type tells us what kind of object it is. We can also call the type of an object, the class of an object, so class and type both mean what kind of object we have.\nWe can see the type/class of a variable/object by using the type function:\n\nprint(a)\ntype(a)\n\n[[1 1 2]\n [3 5 8]]\n\n\nnumpy.ndarray\n\n\nThe numpy.ndarray is the core object/data type in the NumPy package. We can check the type of an entry in the array by indexing:\n\nprint(a[0,0])\ntype(a[0,0])\n\n1\n\n\nnumpy.int64\n\n\nNotice the type of the value 1 in the array is numpy.int64 and not just the standard Python integer type int. The NumPy type numpy.int64 is telling us 1 is an integer stored as a 64-bit number. NumPy has its own data types to deal with numbers depending on memory storage and floating point precision, click here to know see all the types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR and Python: indexing\n\n\n\nRemember that in Python the indexing starts from 0, while in R it starts from 1. If you learned R first, this might seem odd but it’s easy to get used to it with some practice. A way to understand this 0-indexing is that, in Python, the index indicates the displacement from the start of the collection. So ‘0 index in an array’ means ‘zero displacement from the start of the array’, in other words, the first element of the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nHow would you access the value 5 in the array a?\n\n\nSince “everything in Python is an object” and every object belongs to a class, we will interact with SO MANY classes in this course. Often, knowing the type of an object is the first step to finding information to code what you want!\n\n\n\nprint was our first example of a Python function. Functions take in a set of arguments, separated by commas, and use those arguments to create an output. There are several built-in funcions in Python, most of them are for interacting with the Python basic data types such as int (integers), float (decimal numbers), str (strings), and bool (boolean values).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument or Parameter?\n\n\n\nWe can interchangeably say arguments or parameters. You will see argument more often in the documentation.\n\n\nWe can ask for information about what a function does function by executing ? followed by the function name:\n\n?print\n\n\nWhat we obtain is a docstring, a special type of comment that is used to document how a function (or class, or module) works. The first line in the docstring is telling us the function name followed by all of its arguments in parentheses. Then there is a short description of what the function does. And finally a list of the arguments and a brief explanation about each of them.\nYou can see there are different types of arguments inside the parenthesis. Roughly speaking, a function has two types of arguments:\n\nnon-optional arguments: arguments you need to specify for the function to do something, and\noptional arguments: arguments that are pre-filled with a default value by the function, but you can override them. Optional arguments appear inside the parenthesis () in the form optional_argument = default_value.\n\n\n\nend is an argument in print with the default value a new line. We can change this argument so that finishes the line with ^_^ instead:\n\nprint('changing the default end argument of the print function', end=' ^_^')\n\nchanging the default end argument of the print function ^_^\n\n\nNotice that before we had always used print without specifying any value for the end argument.\n\n\n\n\nAn object in Python has attributes and methods. An attribute is a property of the object, some piece of information about it. A method is a procedure associated with an object, so it is an action where the main ingredient is the object.\nFor example, these could be some attributes and methods for class cat:\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nMore formally, a method is a function that acts on the object it is part of.\nWe can access a variable’s attributes and methods by adding a period . at the end of the variable’s name. So we would write variable.variable_method() or variable.variable_attribute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nSuppose we have a class fish, make a diagram similar to the cat class diagram showing 3 attributes for the class and 3 methods.\n\n\n\n\nNumPy arrays have many methods and attributes. Let’s see some concrete examples.\n\n# a 3x3 array\nvar = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\nvar\n\narray([[1, 2, 3],\n       [4, 5, 6],\n       [7, 8, 9]])\n\n\nT is an example of attribute, it returns the transpose of var:\n\nprint(var.T)\nprint(type(var.T))\n\n[[1 4 7]\n [2 5 8]\n [3 6 9]]\n&lt;class 'numpy.ndarray'&gt;\n\n\nshape, another attribute, tells us the shape of the array:\n\nprint(var.shape)\nprint(type(var.shape))\n\n(3, 3)\n&lt;class 'tuple'&gt;\n\n\nndim is an attribute holding the number of array dimensions\n\nprint(var.ndim)\nprint(type(var.ndim))\n\n2\n&lt;class 'int'&gt;\n\n\nNotice these attributes can have many different data types. Here we saw a tuple and an int (two of the basic Python classes) and also a NumPy array as attributes of var.\nNow some examples of methods.\nThe tolist method returns the array as a nested list of scalars:\n\nvar.tolist()\n\n[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n\n\nThe min method returns the minimum value in the array along a specified axis:\n\nvar.min(axis=0)\n\narray([1, 2, 3])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nWe can also call the min method without any parameters:\n\nvar.min()\n\n1\n\n\nWhat kind of parameter is axis in our previous call of the var method?\n\n\nRemember, methods are functions associated to an object. We can confirm this!\n\ntype(var.tolist)\n\nbuiltin_function_or_method\n\n\n\ntype(var.min)\n\nbuiltin_function_or_method\n\n\nYou can see a complete list of NumPy array’s methods and attributes in the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR and Python: are there methods in R?\n\n\n\nIt is uncommon to use methods within an object in R. Rather, functions are extrinsic to the objects they are acting on. In R, for example, there would usually be two separate items: the variable var and a separate function min that gets var as a parameter:\n# this is R code\nvar &lt;- array(c(1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9), dim =c(3,3))\nmin(var)\nUsing the pipe operator %&gt;% in R’s tidyverse is closer to the dot . in Python:\n# this is R code\nvar &lt;- array(c(1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9), dim =c(3,3))\nvar %&gt;% min()\nWhat happens here is that the pipe %&gt;% is passing var to the min() function as its first argument. This is similar to what happens in Python when a function is a method of a class:\n# this is Python code\nvar = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\nvar.min()\nWhen working in Python, remember that methods are functions that are part of an object and a method uses the object it is part of to produce some information.",

A method is a procedure associated with an object, so it is an action where the main ingredient is the object.\nFor example, these could be some attributes and methods for class cat:\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nMore formally, a method is a function that acts on the object it is part of.\nWe can access a variable’s attributes and methods by adding a period . at the end of the variable’s name. So we would write variable.variable_method() or variable.variable_attribute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nSuppose we have a class fish, make a diagram similar to the cat class diagram showing 3 attributes for the class and 3 methods.\n\n\n\n\nNumPy arrays have many methods and attributes. Let’s see some concrete examples.\n\n# a 3x3 array\nvar = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\nvar\n\narray([[1, 2, 3],\n       [4, 5, 6],\n       [7, 8, 9]])\n\n\nT is an example of attribute, it returns the transpose of var:\n\nprint(var.T)\nprint(type(var.T))\n\n[[1 4 7]\n [2 5 8]\n [3 6 9]]\n&lt;class 'numpy.ndarray'&gt;\n\n\nshape, another attribute, tells us the shape of the array:\n\nprint(var.shape)\nprint(type(var.shape))\n\n(3, 3)\n&lt;class 'tuple'&gt;\n\n\nndim is an attribute holding the number of array dimensions\n\nprint(var.ndim)\nprint(type(var.ndim))\n\n2\n&lt;class 'int'&gt;\n\n\nNotice these attributes can have many different data types. Here we saw a tuple and an int (two of the basic Python classes) and also a NumPy array as attributes of var.\nNow some examples of methods.\nThe tolist method returns the array as a nested list of scalars:\n\nvar.tolist()\n\n[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n\n\nThe min method returns the minimum value in the array along a specified axis:\n\nvar.min(axis=0)\n\narray([1, 2, 3])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nWe can also call the min method without any parameters:\n\nvar.min()\n\n1\n\n\nWhat kind of parameter is axis in our previous call of the var method?\n\n\nRemember, methods are functions associated to an object. We can confirm this!\n\ntype(var.tolist)\n\nbuiltin_function_or_method\n\n\n\ntype(var.min)\n\nbuiltin_function_or_method\n\n\nYou can see a complete list of NumPy array’s methods and attributes in the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR and Python: are there methods in R?\n\n\n\nIt is uncommon to use methods within an object in R. Rather, functions are extrinsic to the objects they are acting on. In R, for example, there would usually be two separate items: the variable var and a separate function min that gets var as a parameter:\n# this is R code\nvar &lt;- array(c(1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9), dim =c(3,3))\nmin(var)\nUsing the pipe operator %&gt;% in R’s tidyverse is closer to the dot . in Python:\n# this is R code\nvar &lt;- array(c(1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9), dim =c(3,3))\nvar %&gt;% min()\nWhat happens here is that the pipe %&gt;% is passing var to the min() function as its first argument. This is similar to what happens in Python when a function is a method of a class:\n# this is Python code\nvar = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\nvar.min()\nWhen working in Python, remember that methods are functions that are part of an object and a method uses the object it is part of to produce some information.",
