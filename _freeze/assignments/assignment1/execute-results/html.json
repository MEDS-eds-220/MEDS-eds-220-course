Task 1 will contribute 20% to the total grade of the assignment and tasks 2 and 3 will contribute 40% each.\n\n\n## Submission instructions \n:::{.callout-warning appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\nThis assignment is due by **11:59 pm on Saturday, September 11**. All tasks for this assignment should be submitted via Gradescope. Make sure you double-check your submission to ensure it satisfies all the items in this checklist:\n\n- [ ] Answer for task 1 must be a PDF file.\n- [ ] Answers for tasks 2 and 3 must be submitted as .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebooks) to Gradescope, *not* a PDF, html or other format.\n- [ ] Ensure your notebooks include a link to your assignment's GitHub repository in the designated section.\n- [ ] The notebooks you submit must have your solutions to the exercises, They *should not be the blank template notebooks*. \n- [ ] The notebooks you submit must include your code *and* all required rendered plots, graphs, and printed output. Run all cells before submitting your .ipynb file and make sure all the outputs are visible.\n- [ ] The notebooks you submit must have the output from the final `grader.check_all()` cell. \n- [ ] Double-check that each notebook or PDF is uploaded to the correct task on Gradescope and that all code and outputs are visible. \n\n**Resubmissions after the due date due to not satisfying one of the checks above will be strictly held to the course's 50%-regrade resubmission policy (see syllabus).**\n\nIf you have any questions about assignment logistics, please reach out to the instructional team by 5 pm Thursday, September 9thth. \n<!-- https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q3DOdj_WszOLbnNhSp7KCeFlxvJX06t4c08RNMw3fHc/edit#slide=id.g290e62f4f2b_0_105 -->\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Rename homework notebooks before uploading them to Gradescope\nFor your [upcoming assignment submission](/assignments/assignment1.qmd), youâ€™ll be downloading your notebooks and then uploading them to Gradescope. Before you upload your finished notebooks to Gradescope, **please rename your notebooks** so they are called\n\n- `hwk1-task2-corals-YOURLASTNAME.ipynb` and \n- `hwk1-task3-earthquakes-YOURLASTNAME.ipynb.` \n\nItâ€™s important to do this so we can keep track of resubmissions. \n\nThanks!\n:::\n\n\n## Otter Grader Checks\n\nThese notebooks utilize the `otter` library and have self contained checks within the notebooks to ensure you are on the right track. Follow the steps below to run the otter grader checks. \n\n1. Run the very first cell of the notebook that contains `#Initialize Otter`\n2. Fill in code where the notebook instructs you to do so. \n3. When you encounter a `gracer.check()` cell, like the image below, run the cell. Doing so will either return an emoji with the text \"q# passed!\", or it will tell you the test did not pass. If your test did not pass, try rereading the prompt and making sure your output is what you would expect. If you canâ€™t figure out where the issue is, discuss it with other people (first option always!), come see Annie or Carmen during OH, or use Slack.\n\n\n<img width=\"717\" height=\"99\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-30 at 2 16 07â€¯PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d76e82a-3c5e-4630-bcf5-c25e26bf5ee7\" />\n\n\n4. The very last cell of the notebook contains a cell with `grader_check_all()`. This runs all tests in the notebook and reports the tests that have passed as well as the ones that have failed. If the output of this cell looks like the image below (question numbers may differ), it means you passed all autograder checks!\n\n<img width=\"825\" height=\"471\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-30 at 1 15 25â€¯PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0a030a7-cce5-4901-b501-bfc2f86120ed\" />\n\n\n:::{.callout-warning appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\nReminders: \n\n- Make sure youâ€™re keeping up with your classmateâ€™s questions and answers on Slack.\n- When submitting your final notebook, please make sure to follow the instructions above regarding how to name the notebook\n:::\n\n\n### AI Policy\n\nIf you use generative AI on this assignment, you are expected to adhere to the following course policies:\n\n- âœ… Cultivate understanding:  You should be able to fully understand, justify, and explain all the work you submit.\n- ðŸ¤” Question AI outputs: The default should be to assume the answers you get from generative AI are incorrect and you must verify any information the platform generates.\n- ðŸš« Academic integrity:  Submitting work you donâ€™t understand or canâ€™t explain or justify will be considered plagiarism, regardless of whether you have disclosed the use of generative AI or not. \n- ðŸ“„ Document any AI use: If you do end up using generative AI in your work, you will need to complete and submit the [Generative AI Use Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ly3MGsnd_d8Uau_kRd3WD4v46vFLKyj2FxEOvL5ihS4/edit?usp=sharing) form and upload it to the \"Generate AI Documentation\" portal on Gradescope. \n\n\n\n## Task 1: Datasheets for Datasets reading\nSo much goes into creating a dataset, and data is more than numbers and words in a file. Without a proper understanding of the whole context where data was created, biases, omissions, and inacuracies can go undetected. The [Datasheets for Datasets](https://doi.org/10.1145/3458723)  @datasheets-for-datasets framework advocates for transparency about the purpose and contents of datasets.\n\nCheck out this short interview with lead author Dr. Timnit Gebru, the executive director of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR), on the motivation to write this article:\n{{< video https://youtu.be/R7s7_T4yXak?si=08iVzefNwRlXVa95 >}}\n\n**Read the paper and write a one-paragraph (between 100 and 150 words) reflection about it. Review the [rubric for this assignment here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GQ8C0APsoIG1R9UQL-QGOtENYi413_Fv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111507336322611936333&rtpof=true&sd=true).** Answer at least one of the following questions for your reflection:\n\n1. Can you think of a dataset you have worked with or encountered in your studies that would have benefited from a datasheet? Explain why or why not, using specific details about the dataset's context, collection methods, or biases.\n\n2. What do you think are the limitations of the datasheets framework? Are there any challenges or risks associated with this approach, and how might they be addressed in practical settings?\n\n3. How does the topic of transparency in datasets relate to your understanding of ethical data science practices? Provide an example where increased transparency could have changed the outcome of a dataset you have used or read about.\n\n4. Based on your previous professional experience, if you were tasked with creating a dataset for a project, what challenges or decisions would you face when creating its datasheet? Reflect on one or two aspects of data collection or transparency that you feel are particularly important.\n\n<!-- TODO: would be nice to have this be a group activity where they create a mini datasheet -->\n\n:::{.callout-warning appearance=\"minimal\"}\nReady to submit your answer?

Fork this repository: [https://github.com/MEDS-eds-220/eds220-hwk1](https://github.com/MEDS-eds-220/eds220-hwk1)\n\n2. In the workbench-1 server, start a new JupyterLab session or access an active one.\n\n3. Using the terminal, clone your `eds220-hwk1` repository into your `eds-220` directory.\n\n4. In the terminal, use `cd` to navigate into the `eds-220-hwk1` directory. Use `pwd` to verify `eds-220-hwk1` is your current working directory.\n:::\n\n## Task 2: Exploring coral diversity data\n\nFor this task we are going to use data about Western Indian Ocean Coral Diversity @mcclanahan_western_2023 stored in the the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) data repository. The author for this dataset is Dr. Tim McClanahan, senior conservation zoologist at Wildlife Conservation Society.  \n\n![Dr. Tim McClanahan underwater surveying coral reefs in coastal Tanzania.
