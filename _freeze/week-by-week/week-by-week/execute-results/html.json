Clone your new repository into your `MEDS/EDS-220` directory in workbench-1. \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false}\n## Preparation for Tuesday class (September 30)\n1. In your `EDS-220/eds220-2025-in-class` directory, create a new Python notebook called `week1-pandas-series.ipynb`.\n2. **Read the notes chapter on [`pandas` series data frames](/book/chapters/lesson-2-series-dataframes.qmd) and follow along with the code.**\n3. **Read the [best practices to write comments](/book/appendices/comments-guidelines.qmd) in the notes.**\n4. Solve the check-in exercises. We'll present these during class.\n5. Make a summary of the lesson. What are the most important concepts or ideas?\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n## Week 1 : Sept 29 - Oct 5\n\n:::{.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" collapse=\"true\" }\n## What happened\n\n### Class 2 (Tuesday)\n\n1. Finished [Python review](/book/chapters/lesson-1-python-review.qmd).\n2. Student presentations of [`pandas.Series` and `pandas.DataFrames`](/book/chapters/lesson-2-series-dataframes.qmd) exercises.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" icon=false}\n## Storing your PAT in the server\n\nTo store your personal access token (PAT) in the server:\n\n## 1. Have a PAT ready\n\nIf you already have a PAT that you can copy paste, you can skip to step 2. Otherwise, create or regenerate one. You can follow the instructions in the [MEDS installation guide](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/MEDS-installation-guide/#GitHub-PAT) or create or regernerate one directly through GitHub.\n\n## 2. Set up the git credential helper\n\na. Using the terminal, navigate to the directory from where you want to push your updates. Make sure you are on that directroy (for example, verify you are on the `eds-2025-in-class` by running `pwd` on the terminal). \n\nb. Run the following command on the terminal:\n\n```default\ngit config --global credential.helper store\n```\nThis indicates to git that you want to store the PAT instead of caching it.\n\nc. Run `git config --global --list` on the terminal. You should see something like this as the output:\n\n```default\nuser.name=carmengg\nuser.email=c_galazgarcia@ucsb.edu\ncredential.helper=store\n```\nThat last line indicates that the credential helper is now `store`. \n\n### 3. Complete a push\n\nGo through the steps to make a push. Git will prompt you for your credentials, use your GitHub username and use the PAT as the password. Press enter and finalize the push!\n\n### 4. Verify credentials\n\na. Go to your user's home directory by running `cd ~`.\n\nb. Run `more .git-credentials`. You should see something like this as the output:\n\n```default\nhttps://carmengg:ghp_XTWwWrEtGfL45iIgU6PPDFd990ceIYydqY@github.com\n```\nThis means your PAT is now stored (*the PAT here is an example*).\n\nGit should have now stored your PAT on the server!\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false}\n## Preparation for Thursday class (October 2)\n1. Create a directory called `data/` within your `eds220-2025-in-class` repository.\n2. Download the CSV file `wetlands_seasonal_bird_diversity.csv` from our [shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1USqhiMLyN8GE05B8WJmHabviJGnmAsLP?usp=sharing).\n3. **Do not push this file to GitHub.**\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n\n### Class 3 (Thursday)\n\n1. Completed activity (see below) to add the `data/` directory to the `.gitignore` file of the `EDS-220/in-class-notebooks/` directory.\n2. Covered [`pandas` subsetting notes](/book/chapters/lesson-3-pandas-subsetting/lesson-3-pandas-subsetting.qmd) up to...\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" icon=false}\n## Edit .gitignore file through terminal\n## Setup:\n1. Download the CSV file `wetlands_seasonal_bird_diversity.csv` from our [shared drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VCmBYZ1LmgmvxQt9KEcczc6KPDlAYRp0/view?usp=share_link).\n\n2. In the workbench 1 server, inside your `EDS-220/in-class-notebooks/` directory, create a new directory called `data`. \n\n3. Using the file navigation panel, upload the `wetlands_seasonal_bird_diversity.csv` file to the `data/` directory. \n\n## In the terminal:\n\n1. Verify you are in the `in-class-notebooks/` directory by using `pwd`. Your output should look like this:\n```default\n/Users/your-username/MEDS/EDS-220/in-class-notebooks\n```\n\n2. Run `git status`. At the end of the output you'll see:\n```default\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n        data/\n```\nThis means git has detected that the `data/` directory exists but it is not yet tracking changes in it. We are in charge of deciding whether we want to track changes in it or not!\n\n3. Run `ls` to see the files in the directory. Your output will look like this, notice the `.gitiginore` file is not listed:\n```default\nREADME.md  week1-lesson1-python-review.ipynb\ndata       week1-lesson3-pandas-subsetting.ipynb\n```\n\n4. Run `ls -a` to see *all* files in the directory, including hidden files (those that start with a period `.`). At this point, your output will look like this:\n```default\n.                   README.md\n..                  data\n.git                week1-lesson1-python-review.ipynb\n.gitignore          week1-lesson3-pandas-subsetting.ipynb\n.ipynb_checkpoints\n```\n\n4. Run `nano .gitignore`. This will open the `.gitignore` file in the `nano` editor.\n\n5. Add the `data/` folder to the `.gitignore` file by adding this text at the top of the file:\n```default\n# Ignore the 'data' directory\ndata/\n```\n\n5. Once you have made your changes, save the file:\n - In `nano`, press `CTRL + O` (the letter O, not zero) to save.\n - Press `Enter` to confirm the file name (`.gitignore`).\n\n6. Exit the editor by pressing `CTRL + X`.\n\n7. Run `less .gitignore` to scroll through the `.gitignore` file and verify the changes are there:\n- Use the arrow keys or `Page Up`/`Page Down` to scroll through the file.\n- Press `q` to exit. \n\n8. Run `git status` and check the output. The `data/` directroy will no longer be listed! You will see your `.gitgnore` having changes ready for commit.\n\n9. Commit and push your changes to the `.gitignore`.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false}\n## Preparation for Tuesday class (October 7)\n1.
