In this discussion section, you will:\n\n- Practice breaking down a question into accessible data wrangling steps\n- Choose approrpiate packages and methods to carry out your analysis\n- Practice finding additional guidance online to carry out your analysis \n\n## Setup\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\n1. Access the workbench-1 server.\n\n2. Navigate to the`eds-220-sections` directory in the file navigation panel and the terminal.\n\n3. Create a new Python notebook inside your `eds-220-sections` directory and rename it to `section-4-yucatan-hurricanes.ipynb`. \n\n4. Use the terminal to push this file to you remote repository. \n:::\n\n## General directions\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\n- Add comments as appropriate along your code.\n- Include markdown cells in between your code cells to add titles and information to each exercise\n- Commit every time you finish a major step. **Remember to write your commits in the imperative mood.**\n:::\n\n## About the data\nIn this discussion section we will use [historical data about hurricanes in the Yucatan Peninsula  @boose_ecological_2023](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-hfr.71.23).\n\nThe Yucatan Peninsula, located in southeastern Mexico and bordered by the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, is a region highly susceptible to hurricanes due to its geographic location. These intense storms bring strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges that significantly impact both terrestrial and coastal ecosystems. Hurricanes can cause widespread deforestation, alter habitats, and disrupt biodiversity,  affecting, among other habitats, mangroves and coral reefs.\n\n![Hurricane Mitch (Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale) impacted the Yucatan Peninsula in late October 1998, with its effects felt most strongly around October 28-29. The Yucatan experienced heavy rains and flooding as Mitch passed near the region. [Image source: NOAA](https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/news/25-years-later-looking-back-the-october-monster-named-mitch)](/discussion-sections/images/hurricane-mitch.jpg)\n\nThis dataset includes information about the Saffir-Simpson hurricane category for each huricane. The [Saffir-Simpson scale](https://www.weather.gov/mfl/saffirsimpson#:~:text=The%20Saffir%2DSimpson%20Hurricane%20Wind,loss%20of%20life%20and%20damage.) is a widely used classification system that categorizes hurricanes based on their sustained wind speeds and potential for damage. Ranging from Category 1 to Category 5, the scale assesses the intensity of hurricanes, with Category 1 being the least severe and Category 5 representing catastrophic storms. Categories 3 and above are considered major hurricanes, capable of causing significant structural damage, flooding, and long-lasting environmental impacts. \n\n\n## 1. Archive exploration\na. Take some time to look through the dataset's description and metadata.\n\nb. In your notebook: use a markdown cell to add a *brief* description of the dataset, including a citation, date of access, and a link to the archive. \n\n\n## 2. Data loading and preliminary exploration\n\na. We will be using the `hf071-01-hurricanes.csv` file. Agree with your team on how you will import this file to your notebook and store it in a variable named `df`. \n\n<!--\n```python\n# VIA FILEPATH\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfp = os.path.join('data', 'hf071-01-hurricanes.csv')\ndf = pd.read_csv(fp)\n\n\n# VIA URL\nURL = 'https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/dataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-hfr.71.23&entityid=ab0fe2bf4f3ad850371ccb9c69d78469'\ndf = pd.read_csv(URL)\n```\n-->\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n**CHECK IN WITH YOUR TEAM** \n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n**MAKE SURE YOU'VE ALL SUCCESSFULLY ACCESSED THE DATA BEFORE CONTINUING**\n</p>\n\nb. Obtain preliminary information and explore this data frame using `pandas` methods. \n\n\n## 4. Brainstorm\nIn this session we want to answer the following question:\n\n> How many hurricanes with Saffir-Simpson category 5 have been registered and what was their duration? \n\na. Individually, write down step-by-step_instructions on how you would wrangle the `df` data frame to answer the question. Do not code anything yet. **Remember:** It’s ok if you don’t know how to code each step - it’s more important to have an idea of what you would like to do.\n\nb. Discuss your step-by-step instructions with your team. What do you see as potential challenges to implementing your plan? \n\nc. As a team, select an initial data wrangling plan for answering the question. \n\n## 9. Data wrangling\n\nApply your plan to answer the question. You may (or not) need to look online to carry out some of the steps in your plan. Totally fine to look for help online if you need to find a specific method! Also, it's ok if the plan changes as you work with the data! Thie brainstorm is to create a shared starting point. \n\n## 8. Collect your code and explain your results\n\na. In a new code cell, collect all the relevant code to create a streamlined workflow to obtain the final data to answer the question. Your code cell should:\n\n- Only print the final results. \n- Not include output from intermediate variables or checks.\n- Not include methods or functions that do not directly contribute to the analysis (even if they don't print anything ex: `df.head()`).\n- If appropriate, combine methods using code chaining instead of creating intermediate variables.\n- Comment your code following our class comments guidelines. \n- Use appropriate line breaks and indentation to make code readable.\n\nb. Write a full sentence explaining the results you obtained. Don't forget to include units.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n**Don't forget to commit, pull, and push changes your final results.**\n</p>\n\nb. Write a full sentence explaining the results you obtained.\n\n<!--\n```python\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfp = os.path.join('data', 'hf071-01-hurricanes.csv')\ndf = pd.read_csv(fp)\n\n# Convert datetime \ndf['start.date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['start.date'])\ndf['end.date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['end.date'])\n\n# Calculate duration of events\ndf['duration']= df['end.date'] - df['start.date']\n\n# Select rows with Saffir-Simpson category 5\ndf[df.ss==5]\n```\n-->\n\n",
