In this discussion section you will practice refactoring code. **Refactoring** means improving the structure or readability of your coude without changing what it does. The goal is to make code cleaner, easier to understand, and easier to maintain. For example, you might refactor by:

- reanming variables to make their purpose clearer
- creating function to take care of repeated tasks
- break down long functions into smaller ones
- simplifying complex logic flows
- streamlining repeated code. 

Though the main goal when we are programming is to make our code do what we want, refactoring is a good habit that can make it easier to build upon our work and share it with others. 

## Setup

## About the data
The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the only global database of natural protected areas, it can be viewed and downloaded at
[www.protectedplanet.net](www.protectedplanet.net). WDPA is a joint project of the United Nations Environment Programme  World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) [@UNEPWCMC_2019]. This dataset includes both marine and terrestrial protected areas, combining both spatial and attribute data [@UNEPWCMC_IUCN_2025].
