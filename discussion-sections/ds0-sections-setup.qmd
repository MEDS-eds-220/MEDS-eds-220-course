## Setup

:::{.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
Get together with your assigned team and work through the activities 1 and 3 together. Our TA will guide activity 2 for the class.
:::

## 1. Create repository

a. Create a new repository on GitHub. Use the following settings:

    - Repository name: `eds220-2024-sections`.

    - Description: Work during discussion sections for the EDS 220 MEDS course.

    -  Keep the repository public.

    - Add a README file.

    - Add a Python .gitignore template.

b. In GitHub, update your repository's README by copy-pasting the following text, do not update `[YOUR NAME HERE]` yet.

```default

**MAKE SURE YOU'VE ALL SUCCESSFULLY SET UP YOUR REPOSITORIES BEFORE CONTINUING**
</p>

## 2. Clone the repository

a. In the Taylor server, start a new JupyterLab session or access an active one.

b. Using the terminal, clone the repository to a new directory under your `EDS-220` directory.

## 3. Update your name and push changes

a. Open the `README.md` file and update the `[YOUR NAME HERE]` with your name. Save your changes.

b. Push your changes to your **remote repository** (remember, in this case, this is how we call the copy of your repo that lives in GitHub). 
To do this, remember the basic git routine:
    1. `git status` : check git status, shows which files are staged, modified, or untracked
    2. `git add FILE-NAME` : stage files that have been updated, these files will be added to your next commit
    3. `git status` : check git status again to confirm you have staged the right files
    4. `git commit -m "Commit message"` : create a commit with message 
    5. `git pull` : pull latest changes before pushing to ensure your local repo is up-to-date
    6. `git push` : push your changes to upstream repo
