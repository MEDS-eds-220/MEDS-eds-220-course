2. Student presentations of [`pandas.Series` and `pandas.DataFrames`](/book/chapters/lesson-2-series-dataframes.qmd) exercises

### Discussion section

There's no setup for this week's discussion section. We'll follow the materials in [Discussion Section 1.](/discussion-sections/ds1-prelim-data-exploration.qmd)

## Week 2 : Oct 7 - Oct 13


### Class 3

1. Completed the following activity to add the `data/` directory to the `.gitignore` file of the `EDS-220/in-class-notebooks/` directory.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Edit .gitignore file through terminal
## Setup:
1. Download the CSV file `wetlands_seasonal_bird_diversity.csv` from our [shared drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VCmBYZ1LmgmvxQt9KEcczc6KPDlAYRp0/view?usp=share_link).

2. In the workbench 1 server, inside your `EDS-220/in-class-notebooks/` directory, create a new directory called `data`. 

3. Using the file navigation panel, upload the `wetlands_seasonal_bird_diversity.csv` file to the `data/` directory. 

## In the terminal:

1. Verify you are in the `in-class-notebooks/` directory by using `pwd`. Your output should look like this:
```default
/Users/your-username/MEDS/EDS-220/in-class-notebooks
```

2. Run `git status`. At the end of the output you'll see:
```default
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        data/
```
This means git knows the `data/` directory exists and we have the risk of adding it to a commit.

3. Run `ls` to see the files in the directory. Your output will look like this, notice the `.gitiginore` file is not listed:
```default
README.md  week1-lesson1-python-review.ipynb
data       week1-lesson3-pandas-subsetting.ipynb
```

4. Run `ls -a` to see *all* files in the directory, including hidden files (those that start with a period `.`). At this point, your output will look like this:
```default
.                   README.md
..                  data
.git                week1-lesson1-python-review.ipynb
.gitignore          week1-lesson3-pandas-subsetting.ipynb
.ipynb_checkpoints
```

4. Run `nano .gitignore`. This will open the `.gitignore` file in the `nano` editor.

5. Add the `data/` folder to the `.gitignore` file by adding this text at the top of the file:
```default
# Ignore the 'data' directory
data/
```

5. Once you have made your changes, save the file:
 - In `nano`, press `CTRL + O` (the letter O, not zero) to save.
 - Press `Enter` to confirm the file name (`.gitignore`).

6. Exit the editor by pressing `CTRL + X`.

7. Run `less .gitignore` to scroll through the `.gitignore` file and verify the changes are there. 
- Use the arrow keys or `Page Up`/`Page Down` to scroll through the file.
- Press `q` to exit. 

8. Run `git status` and check the output. The `data/` directroy will no longer be listed!

9. Commit and push your changes to the `.gitignore`.

3. Covered [Python review](/book/chapters/lesson-3-pandas-subsetting/lesson-3-pandas-subsetting.qmd) up to X.

## Preparation for Wednesday class (October 9)
1. In your `EDS-220/eds220-2024-in-class` directory, create a new Python notebook called `week2-basic-plotting.ipynb`.
2. **Read the notes on [basic plotting](/book/chapters/lesson-4-plotting-pandas.qmd) up to and including the "updating the index" section and follow along with the code.**
2. Solve the check-in exercises. We'll present these during class.
3. Make a summary of this part of the lesson. What are the most important concepts or ideas?
