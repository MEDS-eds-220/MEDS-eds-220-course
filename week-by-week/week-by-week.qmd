## Week 1 : Sept 29 - Oct 5

:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal" collapse="true" }
## What happened

### Class 2 (Tuesday)

1. Finished [Python review](/book/chapters/lesson-1-python-review.qmd).
2. Student presentations of [`pandas.Series` and `pandas.DataFrames`](/book/chapters/lesson-2-series-dataframes.qmd) exercises.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon=false}
## Storing your PAT in the server

To store your personal access token (PAT) in the server:

## 1. Have a PAT ready

If you already have a PAT that you can copy paste, you can skip to step 2. Otherwise, create or regenerate one. You can follow the instructions in the [MEDS installation guide](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/MEDS-installation-guide/#GitHub-PAT) or create or regernerate one directly through GitHub.

## 2. Set up the git credential helper

a. Using the terminal, navigate to the directory from where you want to push your updates. Make sure you are on that directroy (for example, verify you are on the `eds-2025-in-class` by running `pwd` on the terminal). 

b. Run the following command on the terminal:

```default
git config --global credential.helper store
```
This indicates to git that you want to store the PAT instead of caching it.

c. Run `git config --global --list` on the terminal. You should see something like this as the output:

```default
user.name=carmengg
user.email=c_galazgarcia@ucsb.edu
credential.helper=store
```
That last line indicates that the credential helper is now `store`. 

### 3. Complete a push

Go through the steps to make a push. Git will prompt you for your credentials, use your GitHub username and use the PAT as the password. Press enter and finalize the push!

### 4. Verify credentials

a. Go to your user's home directory by running `cd ~`.

b. Run `more .git-credentials`. You should see something like this as the output:

```default
https://carmengg:ghp_XTWwWrEtGfL45iIgU6PPDFd990ceIYydqY@github.com
```
This means your PAT is now stored (*the PAT here is an example*).

Git should have now stored your PAT on the server!

## Preparation for Thursday class (October 2)
1. Create a directory called `data/` within your `eds220-2025-in-class` repository.
2. Download the CSV file `wetlands_seasonal_bird_diversity.csv` from our [shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1USqhiMLyN8GE05B8WJmHabviJGnmAsLP?usp=sharing).
3. **Do not push this file to GitHub.**
:::

<br>

### Class 3 (Thursday)

1. Completed activity (see below) to add the `data/` directory to the `.gitignore` file of the `EDS-220/in-class-notebooks/` directory.
2. Covered [`pandas` subsetting notes](/book/chapters/lesson-3-pandas-subsetting/lesson-3-pandas-subsetting.qmd) up to...

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon=false}
## Edit .gitignore file through terminal
## Setup:
1. Download the CSV file `wetlands_seasonal_bird_diversity.csv` from our [shared drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VCmBYZ1LmgmvxQt9KEcczc6KPDlAYRp0/view?usp=share_link).

2. In the workbench 1 server, inside your `EDS-220/in-class-notebooks/` directory, create a new directory called `data`. 

3. Using the file navigation panel, upload the `wetlands_seasonal_bird_diversity.csv` file to the `data/` directory. 

## In the terminal:

1. Verify you are in the `in-class-notebooks/` directory by using `pwd`. Your output should look like this:
```default
/Users/your-username/MEDS/EDS-220/in-class-notebooks
```

2. Run `git status`. At the end of the output you'll see:
```default
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        data/
```
This means git has detected that the `data/` directory exists but it is not yet tracking changes in it. We are in charge of deciding whether we want to track changes in it or not!

3. Run `ls` to see the files in the directory. Your output will look like this, notice the `.gitiginore` file is not listed:
```default
README.md  week1-lesson1-python-review.ipynb
data       week1-lesson3-pandas-subsetting.ipynb
```

4. Run `ls -a` to see *all* files in the directory, including hidden files (those that start with a period `.`). At this point, your output will look like this:
```default
.                   README.md
..                  data
.git                week1-lesson1-python-review.ipynb
.gitignore          week1-lesson3-pandas-subsetting.ipynb
.ipynb_checkpoints
```

4. Run `nano .gitignore`. This will open the `.gitignore` file in the `nano` editor.

5. Add the `data/` folder to the `.gitignore` file by adding this text at the top of the file:
```default
# Ignore the 'data' directory
data/
```

5. Once you have made your changes, save the file:
 - In `nano`, press `CTRL + O` (the letter O, not zero) to save.
 - Press `Enter` to confirm the file name (`.gitignore`).

6. Exit the editor by pressing `CTRL + X`.

7. Run `less .gitignore` to scroll through the `.gitignore` file and verify the changes are there:
- Use the arrow keys or `Page Up`/`Page Down` to scroll through the file.
- Press `q` to exit. 

8. Run `git status` and check the output. The `data/` directroy will no longer be listed! You will see your `.gitgnore` having changes ready for commit.

9. Commit and push your changes to the `.gitignore`.

1. Built conda environment for the course on personal computers.
2. Covered [time series notes](/book/chapters/lesson-7-time-series.qmd) @ workbench.
3. Reviewed git workflow with personal computer and workbench.

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse="true" }
## Build conda environment for the course
*Make sure you have completed the VSCode set-up before creating the environment.*

1. Open VSCode on your computer.

2. Download the following YAML file and move it into your `eds220-in-class`  directory: [https://github.com/MEDS-eds-220/MEDS-eds-220-course/blob/main/eds220-env.yml](https://github.com/MEDS-eds-220/MEDS-eds-220-course/blob/main/eds220-env.yml)

4. Open a bash terminal inside VSCode and in it:
  a. Verify you are in the `eds220-in-class` directory. 
  b. Verify that the `eds220-env.yml` file is in the directory.
  c. Run the following conda command to build the environment used for the course:
  ```default
  conda env create --name eds220-env --file eds220-env.yml
  ```
    
It will take about 15 minutes to build the environment. Once conda has finished, verify that the environment was created by running `conda env list`. 
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse="true" }
## Add Jupyter kernel for course environment
*Make sure you have built the eds220-env before creating the kernel.*

1. Open VSCode on your computer.

2. Add a new bash terminal in it. 

3. Verify you have the `eds220-env` conda environment available by running
```bash
conda env list
```

4. Activate the `eds220-env` by running
```bash
conda activate eds220-env
```

5. Verify the environment has been activated. Then run
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name eds220-env --display-name "EDS-220 env"
```
6. Verify that the kernel has been created by running
```bash
jupyter kernelspec list
```
The output should look similar to this:
```bash
Available kernels:
  eds220-env        /Users/galaz-garcia/Library/Jupyter/kernels/eds220-env
  python3           /Users/galaz-garcia/opt/anaconda3/share/jupyter/kernels/python3
```
