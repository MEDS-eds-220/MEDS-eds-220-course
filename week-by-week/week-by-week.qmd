## Week 1 : Sept 29 - Oct 5

:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal" collapse="true" }
## What happened

### Class 2 (Tuesday)

1. Finished [Python review](/book/chapters/lesson-1-python-review.qmd).
2. Student presentations of [`pandas.Series` and `pandas.DataFrames`](/book/chapters/lesson-2-series-dataframes.qmd) exercises.

## Storing your PAT in the server

To store your personal access token (PAT) in the server:

## 1. Have a PAT ready

If you already have a PAT that you can copy paste, you can skip to step 2. Otherwise, create or regenerate one. You can follow the instructions in the [MEDS installation guide](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/MEDS-installation-guide/#GitHub-PAT) or create or regernerate one directly through GitHub.

## 2. Set up the git credential helper

a. Using the terminal, navigate to the directory from where you want to push your updates. Make sure you are on that directroy (for example, verify you are on the `eds-2025-in-class` by running `pwd` on the terminal). 

b. Run the following command on the terminal:

```default
git config --global credential.helper store
```
This indicates to git that you want to store the PAT instead of caching it.

c. Run `git config --global --list` on the terminal. You should see something like this as the output:

```default
user.name=carmengg
user.email=c_galazgarcia@ucsb.edu
credential.helper=store
```
That last line indicates that the credential helper is now `store`. 

### 3. Complete a push

Go through the steps to make a push. Git will prompt you for your credentials, use your GitHub username and use the PAT as the password. Press enter and finalize the push!

### 4. Verify credentials

a. Go to your user's home directory by running `cd ~`.

b. Run `more .git-credentials`. You should see something like this as the output:

```default
https://carmengg:ghp_XTWwWrEtGfL45iIgU6PPDFd990ceIYydqY@github.com
```
This means your PAT is now stored (*the PAT here is an example*).

Git should have now stored your PAT on the server!

### Class 3 (Thursday)

1. Completed activity (see below) to add the `data` directory to the `.gitignore` file of the `EDS-220/in-class-notebooks/` directory.
2. Covered [`pandas` subsetting notes](/book/chapters/lesson-3-pandas-subsetting/lesson-3-pandas-subsetting.qmd) up to...

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon=false}
## Edit .gitignore file through terminal
## Setup:
1. Download the CSV file `wetlands_seasonal_bird_diversity.csv` from our [shared drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VCmBYZ1LmgmvxQt9KEcczc6KPDlAYRp0/view?usp=share_link).

2. In the workbench 1 server, inside your `EDS-220/in-class-notebooks/` directory, create a new directory called `data`. 

3. Using the file navigation panel, upload the `wetlands_seasonal_bird_diversity.csv` file to the `data` directory. 

## In the terminal:

1. Verify you are in the `in-class-notebooks/` directory by using `pwd`. Your output should look like this:
```default
/Users/your-username/MEDS/EDS-220/in-class-notebooks
```

2. Run `git status`. At the end of the output you'll see:
```default
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        data/
```
This means git has detected that the `data` directory exists but it is not yet tracking changes in it. We are in charge of deciding whether we want to track changes in it or not!

3. Run `ls` to see the files in the directory. Your output will look like this, notice the `.gitiginore` file is not listed:
```default
README.md  week1-lesson1-python-review.ipynb
data       week1-lesson3-pandas-subsetting.ipynb
```

4. Run `ls -a` to see *all* files in the directory, including hidden files (those that start with a period `.`). At this point, your output will look like this:
```default
.                   README.md
..                  data
.git                week1-lesson1-python-review.ipynb
.gitignore          week1-lesson3-pandas-subsetting.ipynb
.ipynb_checkpoints
```

4. Run `nano .gitignore`. This will open the `.gitignore` file in the `nano` editor.

5. Add the `data` folder to the `.gitignore` file by adding this text at the top of the file:
```default
# Ignore the 'data' directory
data/
```

5. Once you have made your changes, save the file:
 - In `nano`, press `CTRL + O` (the letter O, not zero) to save.
 - Press `Enter` to confirm the file name (`.gitignore`).

6. Exit the editor by pressing `CTRL + X`.

7. Run `less .gitignore` to scroll through the `.gitignore` file and verify the changes are there:
- Use the arrow keys or `Page Up`/`Page Down` to scroll through the file.
- Press `q` to exit. 

8. Run `git status` and check the output. The `data` directroy will no longer be listed! You will see your `.gitgnore` having changes ready for commit.

9. Commit and push your changes to the `.gitignore`.

## What happened

### Class 11 (Tuesday)
- Covered functions and exercises

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse="true" }
## Class 11 exercises
**Exercise 1**

Create a function called `power_source_counts` that, given a power source, returns a Series with the counts of power plants by state that use that source.

Follow the steps:

1. solve the problem for a specific example (e.g., 'wind')
2. identify which parts of the code need to be generalized and update these parts
3. wrap this into a function
4. add additional parameters or assert statements if needed

**Exercise 2**

1. Recreate the following plot.
2. Make a function that produces this plot for any power source. 
3. Brainstorm ways in which your function might break or not produced the desired output.

![](images/week6-exercise1.png)

**Bonus**
Create a function that, for a given power source, produces a plot like this one. Many ways of doing it, a hint could be to zip three things together: the axes, the top 3 states, and the counts of power plants in those states. 

```python
# Example of more than two zipped items

for a, b, c in zip([1,2,3], ['x','y','z'], [10,20,30]):
    print(a, b, c)

4. Download the notebook [`week7-clipping-STUDENTS.ipynb`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L1bvxICUy1OkW5_UNMA_WTjOCXUaE8Nz?usp=sharing), rename it to `week7-clipping.ipynb`, and move it into your `EDS-220/eds220-in-class` directory.
5. Edit the notebook if needed to load the three datasets (the third is already in your computer). Make sure you have all the data loaded before class! 🙌

### Discussion section
We'll be using a fairly big dataset so we'll work on the workbench where this data has already been stored. 

You can work directly on the workbench or you can practice [using VSCode to SSH into workbench-1](https://bren.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/34725004003988-Using-VS-Code-to-SSH-into-Bren-Servers). 

If you decide to SSH into workbench-1, **practice before discussion section** and make sure you can run a notebook (any) from your in-class directory.

### Class 13 (Thursday)

- Covered the [clipping notes](/book/chapters/lesson-13-clipping/lesson-13-clipping.qmd). 

We started from a pre-filled notebook [`week7-clipping-STUDENTS.ipynb`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L1bvxICUy1OkW5_UNMA_WTjOCXUaE8Nz?usp=sharing) that students downloaded before class.

## Preparation for next class
Download the notebook [`week8-xarray-STUDENTS.ipynb`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L1bvxICUy1OkW5_UNMA_WTjOCXUaE8Nz?usp=sharing), rename it to `week8-xarray.ipynb`, and move it into your `EDS-220/eds220-in-class` directory. 

There's nothing to run in this notebook. We'll just use it to have some pre-filled code.

## Preparation for next class
1. Download the following datasets from the [course's Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1USqhiMLyN8GE05B8WJmHabviJGnmAsLP?usp=share_link) and add them to the `data` directory in your `eds-220-sections` directory:
  
  - `NAIP_SB/NAIP_SB_nir.tif`
  - `NAIP_SB/NAIP_SB_rgb.tif`
  - `SB_aoi.geojson`

2. Download the notebook [`week8-rioxarray-STUDENTS.ipynb`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L1bvxICUy1OkW5_UNMA_WTjOCXUaE8Nz?usp=sharing), rename it to `week8-rioxarray.ipynb`, and move it into your `EDS-220/eds220-in-class` directory. 

3. Update the file path in the code cell so it points to your data folder containing the rasters and the geoJSON file.

There's nothing to run in this notebook. We'll just use it to have some pre-filled explanations.
