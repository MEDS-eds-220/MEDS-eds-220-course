## Week 1 : Sept 29 - Oct 5

:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal" collapse="true" }
## What happened

### Class 2 (Tuesday)

1. Finished [Python review](/book/chapters/lesson-1-python-review.qmd).
2. Student presentations of [`pandas.Series` and `pandas.DataFrames`](/book/chapters/lesson-2-series-dataframes.qmd) exercises.

## Storing your PAT in the server

To store your personal access token (PAT) in the server:

## 1. Have a PAT ready

If you already have a PAT that you can copy paste, you can skip to step 2. Otherwise, create or regenerate one. You can follow the instructions in the [MEDS installation guide](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/MEDS-installation-guide/#GitHub-PAT) or create or regernerate one directly through GitHub.

## 2. Set up the git credential helper

a. Using the terminal, navigate to the directory from where you want to push your updates. Make sure you are on that directroy (for example, verify you are on the `eds-2025-in-class` by running `pwd` on the terminal). 

b. Run the following command on the terminal:

```default
git config --global credential.helper store
```
This indicates to git that you want to store the PAT instead of caching it.

c. Run `git config --global --list` on the terminal. You should see something like this as the output:

```default
user.name=carmengg
user.email=c_galazgarcia@ucsb.edu
credential.helper=store
```
That last line indicates that the credential helper is now `store`. 

### 3. Complete a push

Go through the steps to make a push. Git will prompt you for your credentials, use your GitHub username and use the PAT as the password. Press enter and finalize the push!

### 4. Verify credentials

a. Go to your user's home directory by running `cd ~`.

b. Run `more .git-credentials`. You should see something like this as the output:

```default
https://carmengg:ghp_XTWwWrEtGfL45iIgU6PPDFd990ceIYydqY@github.com
```
This means your PAT is now stored (*the PAT here is an example*).

Git should have now stored your PAT on the server!

## Preparation for Thursday class (October 2)
1. Create a directory called `data/` within your `eds220-2025-in-class` repository.
2. Download the CSV file `wetlands_seasonal_bird_diversity.csv` from our [shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1USqhiMLyN8GE05B8WJmHabviJGnmAsLP?usp=sharing).
3. **Do not push this file to GitHub.**

<!-- 
### Class 3 (Thursday)

1. Completed activity (see below) to add the `data/` directory to the `.gitignore` file of the `EDS-220/in-class-notebooks/` directory.
2. Covered [`pandas` subsetting notes](/book/chapters/lesson-3-pandas-subsetting/lesson-3-pandas-subsetting.qmd) up to selecting rows using a condition.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon=false}
## Edit .gitignore file through terminal
## Setup:
1. Download the CSV file `wetlands_seasonal_bird_diversity.csv` from our [shared drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VCmBYZ1LmgmvxQt9KEcczc6KPDlAYRp0/view?usp=share_link).

2. In the workbench 1 server, inside your `EDS-220/in-class-notebooks/` directory, create a new directory called `data`. 

3. Using the file navigation panel, upload the `wetlands_seasonal_bird_diversity.csv` file to the `data/` directory. 

## In the terminal:

1. Verify you are in the `in-class-notebooks/` directory by using `pwd`. Your output should look like this:
```default
/Users/your-username/MEDS/EDS-220/in-class-notebooks
```

2. Run `git status`. At the end of the output you'll see:
```default
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        data/
```
This means git has detected that the `data/` directory exists but it is not yet tracking changes in it. We are in charge of deciding whether we want to track changes in it or not!

3. Run `ls` to see the files in the directory. Your output will look like this, notice the `.gitiginore` file is not listed:
```default
README.md  week1-lesson1-python-review.ipynb
data       week1-lesson3-pandas-subsetting.ipynb
```

4. Run `ls -a` to see *all* files in the directory, including hidden files (those that start with a period `.`). At this point, your output will look like this:
```default
.                   README.md
..                  data
.git                week1-lesson1-python-review.ipynb
.gitignore          week1-lesson3-pandas-subsetting.ipynb
.ipynb_checkpoints
```

4. Run `nano .gitignore`. This will open the `.gitignore` file in the `nano` editor.

5. Add the `data/` folder to the `.gitignore` file by adding this text at the top of the file:
```default
# Ignore the 'data' directory
data/
```

5. Once you have made your changes, save the file:
 - In `nano`, press `CTRL + O` (the letter O, not zero) to save.
 - Press `Enter` to confirm the file name (`.gitignore`).

6. Exit the editor by pressing `CTRL + X`.

7. Run `less .gitignore` to scroll through the `.gitignore` file and verify the changes are there:
- Use the arrow keys or `Page Up`/`Page Down` to scroll through the file.
- Press `q` to exit. 

8. Run `git status` and check the output. The `data/` directroy will no longer be listed! You will see your `.gitgnore` having changes ready for commit.

9. Commit and push your changes to the `.gitignore`.

## Preparation for Wednesday class (October 9)
1. In your `EDS-220/eds220-2024-in-class` directory, create a new Python notebook called `week2-basic-plotting.ipynb`.
2. **Read the notes on [basic plotting](/book/chapters/lesson-4-plotting-pandas.qmd) up to and including the "updating the index" section and follow along with the code.**
2. Solve the check-in exercises. We'll present these during class.
3. Make a summary of this part of the lesson. What are the most important concepts or ideas?

2. Student presentations of [basic plotting](/book/chapters/lesson-4-plotting-pandas.qmd) exercises
3. Covered [basic plotting](/book/chapters/lesson-4-plotting-pandas.qmd) up to scatter plots. The last two sections, about bar plots and histograms were assigned as reading. 

### Discussion section

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
Complete steps 1,2 and 3 of the [second discussion section](/discussion-sections/ds-2-water-crisis-exploration.qmd) to load the data before the discussion section.
Youâ€™ll be working on exercises 4-9 during section, so it is important that you have the data ready to go tomorrow.

Check-in with your discussion section teams via Slack just to make sure youâ€™re all ready! :raised_hands:
:::

### Homework announcements
::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Rename homework notebooks before uploading them to Gradescope
For your [upcoming assignment submission](/assignments/assignment1.qmd), youâ€™ll be downloading your notebooks and then uploading them to Gradescope. Before you upload your finished notebooks to Gradescope, **please rename your notebooks** so they are called

- `hwk1-task2-corals-YOURLASTNAME.ipynb` and 
- `hwk1-task3-earthquakes-YOURLASTNAME.ipynb.` 

Itâ€™s important to do this so we can keep track of resubmissions. 

Thanks!
:::

::: {.callout-warning icon=false} 
## Updates to Gradescope's autograder
Hereâ€™s updates about how auto-grading will work in this first assignment:

- **If you want to know your autograder score at any point**, you may upload your notebook to the `Homework 1 Task 2 - AUTOGRADER CHECK ONLY` or `Homework 1 Task 3 - AUTOGRADER CHECK ONLY` assignments on gradescope.
  - Once you submit your assignment,  you will be able to see your total score for the auto-grading, not the score for individual questions.
  - If you donâ€™t have a 20/20 score in your auto-grade questions, it means there is some mistake with your code and you should go back and review it. If you canâ€™t figure out where the issue is, discuss it with other people (first option always!), come see Annie or Carmen during OH, or use Slack.

- The `AUTOGRADER CHECK ONLY` assignments on gradescope are strictly for you to see how you did on the assignment. We will not be using these grades at all
- You must still submit your final assignment to the `Homework 1- Task 2 - Corals` and `Homework 1 - Task 3 - Earthquakes` assignment
- Make sure youâ€™re keeping up with your classmateâ€™s questions and answers on Slack.
- When submitting your final notebook, please make sure to follow the instructions above regarding how to name the notebook

Thanks for your patience as we work through these initial Autograder kinks!

### Class 7

1. Built [conda environment](/book/appendices/A-python-environments.qmd) for the course.
 
::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse="true" }
## How to build the conda environment for the course in your computer
  1. Open VSCode on your computer.

  2. Clone your `eds220-2024-in-class` GitHub repository. You can do it using the command palette. 

  3. Download the following YAML file and move it to the top of your `eds220-2024-in-class` local directory:
    [https://github.com/MEDS-eds-220/MEDS-eds-220-course/blob/main/eds-220-env.yml]()

  4. Open a terminal inside VSCode and in it:

  a. Verify you are in the `eds220-2024-in-class` directory. 
  b. Verify that the `eds-220-env.yml` file is in the directory.
  c. Run the following conda command to build the environment used for the course:
  ```default
  conda env create --name eds220-env --file eds-220-env.yml
  ```
    
It will take about 10 minutes to build the environment. Once conda has finished, verify that the environment is listed. Inside VSCode, you'll be able to select the `eds220-env` kernel to run your notebooks.
