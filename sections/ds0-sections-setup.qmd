1. Create a new repository on GitHub. Use the following settings:

    a. Call the repository `eds-220-section-1`.

    b. Add a brief description for your new repository. For example: EDS 220 section - practice session for data selection in pandas.

    c. Keep the repository public.

    d. Initialize the repository with a `README` file and a Python .gitignore template.

2. In the Taylor server, start a new JupyterLab session or access an active one.

3. Using the terminal, clone the repository to a new directory under your `eds-220` directory.


Talk about setting a PAT.

6. If you are prompted for your credentials and need to set up a new Personal Access Token (PAT) follow [steps 13-18 in this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pk6_rUDdFjdGg-YVo9Cl8ET3iDsYahyaP0VMRD4UHUk/edit?usp=sharing/) to set it up.
