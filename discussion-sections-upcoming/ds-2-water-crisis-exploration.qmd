This discussion section will guide you through answering questions about water-related conflicts at the Colorado River Basin using data from the [U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)](https://www.usgs.gov). In this discussion section, you will:

- Practice version control using git via the terminal
- Obtain information about a dataset from an online data repository
- Use core `pandas.DataFrame` methods to answer questions 
- Discuss advantages and disadvantages about different methods of data loading
- Practice best practices for clean code

## Setup

:::{.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
1. In the Taylor server, start a new JupyterLab session or access an active one.

2. In the terminal, use `cd` to navigate into the `eds-220-sections` directory. Use `pwd` to verify `eds-220-sections` is your current working directory.

3. Create a new Python Notebook inside your `eds-220-sections` directory and rename it to `section-2-co-basin-water-conflicts.ipynb`. 

4. Use the terminal to stage, commit, and push this file to the remote repository. Remember:
    1. `git status` : check git status
    2. `git add FILE-NAME` : stage updated file
    3. `git status` : check git status again to confirm
    4. `git commit -m "Commit message"` : commit with message
    5. `git pull` : check local repo is up to date (best practice)
    5. `git push` : push changes to upstream repository

## General directions
:::{.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
- Add comments in each one of your code cells. 
- On each exercise, include markdown cells in between your code cells to add titles and information.
- Indications about when to commit and push changes are included, but you are encouraged to commit and push more often.

## About the data
For these exercises we will use data about [Water Conflict and Crisis Events in the Colorado River Basin](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/63acac09d34e92aad3ca1480) @holloman_coded_2023. This dataset is stored at [ScienceBase](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/),a digital repository from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) created to share scientific data products and USGS resources. 

The dataset is a CSV file containing conflict or crisis around water resource management in the Colorado River Basin. 
The Colorado River Basin, inhabited by several Native American tribes for centuries, is a crucial water source in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, supporting over 40 million people, extensive agricultural lands, and diverse ecosystems. 
Its management is vital due to the region's arid climate and the competing demands for water, leading to significant challenges related to water allocation and conservation.

<!-- 10 minutes -->
## 1. Archive exploration
Take some time to look through the dataset's description in the ScienceBase epository. Discuss the following questions with your team:

a. Where was the data collected from?
<!-- 
articles from newspapers describing water-related events in geographic areas in the Basin
-->
b. During what time frame were the observations in the dataset collected?
<!--
2005-2021
-->
c. Whta was the author's perceived value of this dataset?
<!--
 examining crisis on a continual basis toward identification of hotspots from conflict, identifying primary stakeholders, and who experiences crises.
-->
e. Briefly discuss anything else that seems like relevant information.

In your notebook, use a markdown cell to add a brief description of the dataset, including a citation, date of access, and a link to the archive.

## 2. Data loading

a. In class we have (so far) loaded data into our workspace both by downloading the file and storing a copy of the dataset in our computer and by accessing directly through a URL. With your team, discuss what can be, in general, the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods of data access. 

b. Import the `Colorado River Basin Water Conflict Table.csv` file [from the Science Base repository](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/63acac09d34e92aad3ca1480) into your workspace using its URL and store it as a variable named `df`.
