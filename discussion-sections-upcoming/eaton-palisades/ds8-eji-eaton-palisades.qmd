## Setup

:::{.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
1. Find fire perimeters for the Eaton and Palisades fires that occurred in Los Angeles County on 2025. There are several datasets with this information online. You will need to independently select one from a reputable source (it may be more than one file). *These are the same files you will use for assignment 4.* 

2. Add the fire perimeter datasets to the `data` directory in your `eds-220-sections` directory.

3. Download the **2024** [Environmental Justice Index data](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/php/eji/eji-data-download.html) for **California** in the **geodatabase** data format. Add it to the `data` directory in your `eds-220-sections` directory.
