A way to keep the packages and Python versions you use for different projects organized. 

**Why use them?**

- To not interfere with your computerâ€™s pre-installed Python.

- Packages usually depend on other packages to work properly, this is called a **package dependency**. Dependencies across different packages need to be carefully managed and may potentially be different across projects.

- Reproducibility! Share your code and where ran it with others

**Conda** is an environment *and* package management system: 

- It can both create and administer the environments and install compatible versions of software and their dependencies.

- Environments created with conda are usually called **conda environments.**

- Can manage packages for any programming language (not just Python).

## {#channels data-menu-title="What are conda channels?"} 

[What are conda channels?]{.slide-title}

<hr>

**Conda channels** are the locations where packages are stored. 

By default, packages are downloaded and updated from the default channel.
But there are others!

We can choose which conda channel to install a package from.

- `pip` is a package management system for Python.

- We can use it to install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI). Only Python packages.

- We can use `pip` inside a conda environment when a package is not available from a conda channel.
