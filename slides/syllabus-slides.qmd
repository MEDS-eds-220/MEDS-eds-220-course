[Attendance]{.slide-title}

<hr>

In-person attendance to classes and discussion sections is crucial!

If you miss a class you are expected to:

- 📩 **Be proactive:** Notify the instructor before it happens or within a day and provide a brief explanation. 

- 🔄 **Catch up:** Work with the instructors to review any missed material.

- 🤒 **Stay home when you are sick!** Prioritize your wellbeing. 

**Attendance does not count towards your grade, but it will be tracked and absences without communication will be addressed.** 

UCSB courses are taught in person, so absences for two or more weeks may require a Leave of Absence. 

There will not be **no option for remote attendance to class** except for the class before Thanksgiving break.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/regrading.png)

::::

**Why regrades?**
Revisions, corrections, and improvements are crucial in the learning process! We greatly encourage you to resubmit your revised assignments.

<br>

. . .

**Example:**
You submitted your homework on time on the due date and got a 6/10 in the assignment the coming Wednesday. You may build on the feedback received to correct your work and resubmit to improve your grade up to 8/10. 


Except for extenuating circumstances, **there will be ​no extension for any assignment.** Late submissions will be accepted at the resubmission date and can obtain up to 50% of the assignment points.


## {#four-day-extension data-menu-title="Regrading"} 

[One-time, 4-day extension]{.slide-title}

<hr>

- Every student may use **one 4-day extension during the quarter, no questions asked**.
- To request it, you will need to send an e-mail to the co-instructor by the homework due date. Only requests by the due date will be accepted.
- May be used for any homework assignment. Does not apply to any of the portfolio deadlines.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- If you use the extension, you will still be able to submit your improved work by the resubmission due date (~1 day turnaround).
- Beyond this extension, late work will only be accepted at the resubmission deadline (worth up to 50% of the assignment points).

## {#portoflio data-menu-title="Portfolio Project"} 

[Portfolio Project]{.slide-title}

<hr>

The final assignment for the course will be creating data science materials for the students’ online professional portfolio. 

**Final Assignment:**

 The 20% grade for the portfolio is divided as follows:

- 13% Data analysis + GitHub repository: a presentation-ready GitHub repository containing a finalized Jupyter Notebook and associated files for the data analysis, 
- 7% blog post: a blog post in the student’s professional portfolio based on previous assignments and discussion sections

**Both a submission and a revised submission addressing all the feedback from the first revision will be needed for these two tasks**.

## {#participation data-menu-title="Participation"} 

[Participation Requirements]{.slide-title}

<hr>

To obtain full participation credit:

* Answer two short surveys about their course experiences, one at the beginning and one at the end of the course. 
* Share  coding solutions for exercises or homework during lecture or discussion sections at least once during the course. 
  - A presentation date during the discussion section has been [randomly assigned to each student](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yf1Wz_W_q3ezWn2rM514DDGMCOYMd-l1pM1kC7mUDNc/edit?usp=sharing).
  - You can trade dates with others. Please notify the TA or instructor about any presentation updates. 
  - Time for presentation during class time may also be available.

. . . 

**Why come up to present your solutions?** Many reasons! To practice public speaking, get comfortable with technical vocabulary,  practice explaining a step-by-step solution, practice the material by teaching others, have a taste of live-coding, among others.

## {#GenAI data-menu-title="GenAI Policy" .smaller} 

[Policy on Generative AI]{.slide-title}

<hr>

GenAI tools (such as ChatGPT) are **strongly discouraged** for the following reasons:

::: incremental
- becoming proficient in core programming skills comes through practice
- building your own programming proficiency will help you engage with GenAI tools more efficiently and responsibly
- we don't expect perfection, we expect learning and improvement through collaboration!
:::

. . .

Please adhere to these guidelines:

::: incremental
- ✅ **Cultivate understanding:**  You should be able to fully understand, justify, and explain all the work you submit.
- 🤔 **Question AI outputs:** The default should be to assume the answers you get from generative AI are incorrect and you must verify any information the platform generates.
- 🚫 **Academic integrity:** Submitting work you don’t understand or can’t explain or justify will be considered plagiarism, regardless of whether you have disclosed the use of generative AI or not. 
- 📄 **Document any AI use:** If you do end up using generative AI in your work, you will need to complete and submit a “Generative AI Use Documentation” form and include it with your assignment. 
:::

**If there are concerns about AI use in your work, your instructor will ask you to meet and talk it through.** 

If understanding is clearly lacking and this is the first time this happens, you’ll have the chance to revise and resubmit your work for 50% of the original maximum grade within two days. 

. . .

::: {.center-text .body-text-l}
**Please read the full policy on the [course syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14dcg7u3n1rEz-fReZcO8Gnddk3hEGi8u4DKTroWdonU/edit?usp=sharing)**

## {#your-questions-1 data-menu-title="Your questions (1)" } 

[Your questions (1)]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<span style="color:blue">
*Will we have more information about what the homework entails in advance of them being assigned?*
</span>

Each assignment is posted the specified Friday and covers the materials seen in the last ~2 weeks. Assignments do build on all the previous course content!

. . .

<span style="color:blue">
*What grading criteria do you use for the homeworks, presentations, and portfolios? Do you use a rubric or specs grading?*
</span>

We provide detailed rubrics for the homeworks and portfolios. The presentations that count for student participation are just completed/not completed. 

. . .

<span style="color:blue">
*The EDS 296-1F course is not offered. How do we make sure to achieve this necessary portfolio creation?*
</span>

Thanks for catching this! You should plan to attend these three workshops to create your personal website:

- Creating personal websites using Quarto (Live session on 10/1)
- Customizing Quarto Websites using CSS & Sass (Live session on 10/15)
- Adding a blog to your existing Quarto website (Live session on 11/12)

## {#your-questions-2 data-menu-title="Your questions (2)" } 

[Your questions (2)]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<span style="color:blue">
*For the discussion section, when presenting will we be taught the material before hand or are we using the material from class to give an example?*
</span>

The discussion section materials are independent of the class materials and will be available about a day in advance, but you are not exepcted to complete them before section. There are sections listed on the website but **discussion sections will be updated this year**. 

. . .

<span style="color:blue">
*I see on the presentation calendar that I’m scheduled to present during week 3, but the syllabus says we each present twice. Should I sign up for my second presentation somewhere, or will we be assigned a second date later?*
</span>

**You will only have to present once!** This has been fixed on the syllabus. Thanks for bringing this to my attention.
