## Homework Assignments

<hr>

<br>
<br>

- There will be 4 homework assignments. 
- Assignments are assigned every other  Friday starting on week 1 and **should be submitted by 11:59 pm on next week’s Saturday**. 

<br>

- Working together and collaborating with peers on homework is highly encouraged! 
- Submissions are individual so make sure you understand everything you are turning in.

### Regrading

<hr>

:::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
You can **resubmit your assignments three days after they have received initial feedback**. 

- In this second submission, you may recover up to 50% of the points not obtained during the initial submission. 
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/regrading.png)
:::
::::

**Why regrades?**
Revisions, corrections, and improvements are crucial in the learning process! We greatly encourage you to resubmit your revised assignments.

<br>

**Example:**
You submitted your homework on time on the due date and got a 6/10 in the assignment the coming Wednesday. You may build on the feedback received to correct your work and resubmit to improve your grade up to 8/10. 


Except for extenuating circumstances, **there will be ​no extension for any assignment.** Late submissions will be accepted at the resubmission date and can obtain up to 50% of the assignment points.

## Portfolio Project

<hr>

The final assignment for the course will be creating data science materials for the students’ online professional portfolio. 

**Final Assignment:**

 The 20% grade for the portfolio is divided as follows:

- 13% Data analysis + GitHub repository: a presentation-ready GitHub repository containing a finalized Jupyter Notebook and associated files for the data analysis, 
- 7% blog post: a blog post in the student’s professional portfolio based on previous assignments and discussion sections

**Both a submission and a revised submission addressing all the feedback from the first revision will be needed for these two tasks**.
