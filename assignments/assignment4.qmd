:::{.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}

This assignment is due by **11:59 pm on Saturday, November 23**. All tasks for this assignment should be submitted via Gradescope. Make sure you double-check your submission to ensure it satisfies all the items in these checklists:

- File formatting and uploading:
  - [ ] Answer for task 1 must be submitted as a PDF file.
  - [ ] Answers for task 2 must be submitted as .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebooks) to Gradescope, *not* a PDF, html or other format.
  - [ ] Double-check that each notebook or PDF is uploaded to the correct task on Gradescope. 
  - [ ] Before you upload your finished notebook to Gradescope, please rename your notebook so they are called
    - `hwk4-task2-fire-scar-YOURLASTNAME.ipynb` and 

- Notebook content checklists:
  - [ ] Ensure your notebooks include a link to your assignment's GitHub repository in the designated section.
  - [ ] The notebooks you submit must have your solutions to the exercises, They *should not be the blank template notebooks*. 
  - [ ] The notebooks you submit must include your code *and* all required rendered plots, graphs, and printed output. Run all cells before submitting your .ipynb file and make sure all the outputs are visible.


**Resubmissions after the due date due to not satisfying one of the checks above will be strictly held to the course's 50%-regrade resubmission policy (see syllabus).**

If you have any questions about assignment logistics, please reach out to the TA or instructor by 5 pm Friday, November 22.

## Task 1: The politics of pixels reading

When working with satellite data, it’s easy to assume that it is inherently objective and equally accessible to everyone. However, Bennett et al., in their paper *The Politics of Pixels: A Review and Agenda for Critical Remote Sensing* (2022 @bennett_politics_2022), challenge this assumption, arguing that remote sensing needs a critical lens. They emphasize that various sociopolitical factors influence who collects remotely sensed data, how it’s collected, and ultimately, who benefits from its insights. This reading will encourage you to explore the biases and inequalities that can be embedded in remote sensing technologies and practices.

**Read the paper and write a one-paragraph (between 100 and 150 words) reflection about it.**
This paper is a bit denser than the others we’ve read, section V is worth special attention.
**Review the [rubric for this assignment here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GQ8C0APsoIG1R9UQL-QGOtENYi413_Fv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111507336322611936333&rtpof=true&sd=true).** Answer at least one of the following questions for your reflection:

1. Reflecting on your personal or professional background, how might sociopolitical factors shape the availability and interpretation of satellite and other remotely sensed data for communities or organizations you’re familiar with?

2. What potential ethical responsibilities arise for environmental data scientists when working with remote sensing data that may carry biases or limitations? 

3. If you were tasked with implementing remote sensing for a project, what steps might you take to ensure the data collected is fair, accessible, and unbiased?

## Setup for task 2

:::{.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
Create a new GitHub repository named `eds220-hwk4`. Within it, create a two notebooks named `hwk4-task2-fire-scar-YOURLASTNAME.ipynb` and `hwk4-task2-fire-perimeter.ipynb`. All your analysis and data wrangling should be contained in this notebook.

Your repository should have the following structure:
```default
eds220-hwk4
│   README.md
|   hwk4-task2-fire-perimeter-YOURLASTNAME.ipynb
│   hwk4-task2-false-color-YOURLASTNAME.ipynb
|   .gitignore

## Task 2:  Visualizing fire scars through false color

Inf this task you will create a false color image showing the fire scar of the Thomas Fire in 2017. 

### About the data

In this task you will use two datsets. The first one is given and it is a simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmosperically corrected surface reflectance data, collected by the Landsat 8 satellite. 

The data was retrieved from the [Microsof Planetary Computer data catalogue](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2) and pre-processed to remove data outside land and coarsen the spatial resolution. This data should be used for visualization and educational purposes only and can be accessed in the `/courses/EDS220/data/` directory within workbench-1. 

The second dataset will be historical open-access data about fire perimeters in California. There are several datasets with this information online. You will need to select one from a reputable source that includes the fire perimeter of the Thomas Fire during 2017.

### Instructions

#### 1. Reading
Read the following resources about false color images and Landsat imagery: 

- [NASA Earth Observatory - Why is that Forest Red and that Cloud Blue?
How to Interpret a False-Color Satellite Image](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/FalseColor)

- [What are the band designations for the Landsat satellites?](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-are-band-designations-landsat-satellites)

- Common Landsat Band Combinations](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/common-landsat-band-combinations)

- [How do I use a scale factor with Landsat Level-2 science products?](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-do-i-use-a-scale-factor-landsat-level-2-science-products)

#### 2. Data retrieval and selection

The following steps must be completed in the `hwk4-task2-fire-perimeter-YOURLASTNAME.ipynb` notebook. 

a. Write a brief description of the fire perimeter data you will use, indicating its source and date of access. 

b. Explore your data and write a brief summary of the information you obtained from the preliminary information. Your summary should include the CRS of the data and whether this is projected or geographic.

b. From your fire perimeter data, select the Thomas Fire boundary. The fire occurred in 2017.

c. Save *only* the Thomas Fire boundary as a geospatial file in the format of your choosing. The file should go into the `data/` directory in your repository.

d. In a markdown cell, briefly explain your reasoning for selecting that specific file format. 
 

#### 2. True color image

a. Without creating any new variables: 
- select the red, green, and blue variables (in that order) of the `xarray.Dataset` holding the Landsat data, 
- convert it to a `numpy.array` using the `to_array()` method, and then 
- use `.plot.imshow()` to create an RGB image with the data. 

b. Adjust the scale used for plotting the bands to get a true color image. 
HINT: [Check the `robust` parameter](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html). The issue here is the clouds: their RGB values are outliers and cause the other values to be squished when plotting. 

c. In a markdown cell write a brief explanation comparing the ouputs for parts (a) and (b) and how these relate to the distribution of 

#### 3. False color image
Without creating any new variables, create a false color image by plotting the short-wave infrared (swir22), near-infrared, and red variables (in that order).

#### 4. Map

Create a map showing the shortwave infrared/near-infrared/red false color image together with the Thomas Fire perimeter. Customize it appropriately.


Both notebooks should include clear sections about data exploration and...
