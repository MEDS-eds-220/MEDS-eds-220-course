## Task 1: Datasheets for Datasets reading
So much goes into creating a dataset, and data is more than numbers and words in a file. Without a proper understanding of the whole context where data was created, biases, omissions, and inacuracies can go undetected. The [Datasheets for Datasets](https://doi.org/10.1145/3458723)  @datasheets-for-datasets advocates for transparency about the purpose and contents of datasets.

Check out this short interview with lead author Dr. Timnit Gebru, the executive director of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR), on the motivation to write this article:

**Read the paper and write a one-paragraph (between 100 and 150 words) open reflection about it. Submit your answer as a PDF via Gradscope.** You may use the following questions as prompts for your reflection, but feel free to discuss any topic in the article that caught your interest.

- How does a framework like the propsed “datasheets for datasets” can help transparency and accountability in data science? Is it feasable to implement it?

- Do you think there is a particular kind of data that may benefit the most from increased transparency about collection methods and processing methods? Why?


## Setup for tasks 2 and 3

## Task 2: Exploring coral diversity data

For this task we are going to use data about Western Indian Ocean Coral Diversity @mcclanahan_western_2023 stored in the the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) data repository. This data was archived by Dr. Tim McClanahan, senior conservation zoologist at Wildlife Conservation Society.
