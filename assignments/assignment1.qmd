## Submission instructions 
:::{.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}

This assignment is due by **11:59 pm on Saturday, September 12**. All tasks for this assignment should be submitted via Gradescope. Make sure you double-check your submission to ensure it satisfies all the items in this checklist:

- [ ] Answer for task 1 must be a PDF file.
- [ ] Answers for tasks 2 and 3 must be submitted as .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebooks) to Gradescope, *not* a PDF, html or other format.
- [ ] Ensure your notebooks include a link to your assignment's GitHub repository in the designated section.
- [ ] The notebooks you submit must have your solutions to the exercises, They *should not be the blank template notebooks*. 
- [ ] The notebooks you submit must include your code *and* all required rendered plots, graphs, and printed output. Run all cells before submitting your .ipynb file and make sure all the outputs are visible.
- [ ] Double-check that each notebook or PDF is uploaded to the correct task on Gradescope. 

**Resubmissions after the due date due to not satisfying one of the checks above will be strictly held to the course's 50%-regrade resubmission policy (see syllabus).**

If you have any questions about assignment logistics, please reach out to the TA or instructor by 5 pm Friday, September 11.

## Task 1: Datasheets for Datasets reading
So much goes into creating a dataset, and data is more than numbers and words in a file. Without a proper understanding of the whole context where data was created, biases, omissions, and inacuracies can go undetected. The [Datasheets for Datasets](https://doi.org/10.1145/3458723)  @datasheets-for-datasets advocates for transparency about the purpose and contents of datasets.

Check out this short interview with lead author Dr. Timnit Gebru, the executive director of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR), on the motivation to write this article:
{{< video https://youtu.be/R7s7_T4yXak?si=08iVzefNwRlXVa95 >}}

**Read the paper and write a one-paragraph (between 100 and 150 words) open reflection about it. Review the [rubric for this assignment here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GQ8C0APsoIG1R9UQL-QGOtENYi413_Fv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111507336322611936333&rtpof=true&sd=true).** Answer at least one of the following questions for your reflection:

1. Can you think of a dataset you have worked with or encountered in your studies that would have benefited from a datasheet? Explain why or why not, using specific details about the dataset's context, collection methods, or biases.

2. What do you think are the limitations of the datasheets framework? Are there any challenges or risks associated with this approach, and how might they be addressed in practical settings?

3. How does the topic of transparency in datasets relate to your understanding of ethical data science practices? Provide an example where increased transparency could have changed the outcome of a dataset you have used or read about.

4. Based on your previous professional experience, if you were tasked with creating a dataset for a project, what challenges or decisions would you face when creating its datasheet? Reflect on one or two aspects of data collection or transparency that you feel are particularly important.

<!-- TODO: would be nice to have this be a group activity where they create a mini datasheet -->

## Setup for tasks 2 and 3

:::{.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}

1. Fork this repository: [https://github.com/MEDS-eds-220/eds220-hwk1](https://github.com/MEDS-eds-220/eds220-hwk1)

2. In the Taylor server, start a new JupyterLab session or access an active one.

3. Using the terminal, clone your `eds220-hwk1` repository into your `eds-220` directory.

4. In the terminal, use `cd` to navigate into the `eds-220-hwk1` directory. Use `pwd` to verify `eds-220-hwk1` is your current working directory.

## Task 2: Exploring coral diversity data

For this task we are going to use data about Western Indian Ocean Coral Diversity @mcclanahan_western_2023 stored in the the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) data repository. The author for this dataset is Dr. Tim McClanahan, senior conservation zoologist at Wildlife Conservation Society.

## Task 3: `pandas` fundamentals with earthquake data

This task is adapted from the *Pandas Fundamentals with Earthquake Data* assignment from the e-book Earth and Environmental Data Science @abernathey_introduction. 

You will use simplified data from the [USGS Earthquakes Database](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/). 


**Follow the instructions in the notebook `hwk1-task3-earthquakes.ipynb` to complete this task.Review the [rubric for this assignment here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/131OnUDOLpOl94SlaMU9nGqT998ABrjFS/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111507336322611936333&rtpof=true&sd=true).** Here you will practice:

- accessing data from your directory 
- selecting data from a data frame 
- creating exploratory graphs
- basic git workflow
- commenting your code
