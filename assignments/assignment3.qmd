## Submission instructions 
:::{.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}

This assignment is due by **11:59 pm on Saturday, November 8**. All tasks for this assignment should be submitted via Gradescope. Make sure you double-check your submission to ensure it satisfies all the items in these checklists:

- File formatting and uploading:
  - [ ] Answer for task 1 must be submitted as a PDF file.
  - [ ] Answers for task 2 must be submitted as .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebooks) to Gradescope, *not* a PDF, html or other format.
  - [ ] Double-check that each notebook or PDF is uploaded to the correct task on Gradescope. 
  - [ ] Before you upload your finished notebook to Gradescope, please rename your notebook so they are called
    - `hwk3-task2-oil-spills-YOURLASTNAME.ipynb` and 

- Notebook content checklists:
  - [ ] Ensure your notebooks include a link to your assignment's GitHub repository in the designated section.
  - [ ] The notebooks you submit must have your solutions to the exercises, They *should not be the blank template notebooks*. 
  - [ ] The notebooks you submit must include your code *and* all required rendered plots, graphs, and printed output. Run all cells before submitting your .ipynb file and make sure all the outputs are visible. The notebook you submit must have the output from the final `grader.check_all()` cell. 


**Resubmissions after the due date due to not satisfying one of the checks above will be strictly held to the course's 50%-regrade resubmission policy (see syllabus).**

## Task 1: FAIR and CARE principles reading

In this task, you'll explore two key frameworks in data governance. The CARE principles @carroll2020care guide us in thinking ethically about Indigenous data, focusing on respect, benefit, and the right of communities to control their own data. The FAIR principles @wilkinson2016fair, on the other hand, encourage us to make data easy to find, use, and share, emphasizing machine-actionability.

**Read the following resources and write a one-paragraph (between 100 and 150 words) reflection about them:** 

- [FAIR principles overview](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) from the GO FAIR Initiative.

- [What is FAIR?](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2023-06-delta/session_16.html#what-is-fair) from the NCEAS learning hub resources @do-linh_open_2023. 

- [The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/6397b1aff7a6fb54defdf687/1670885815820/dsj-1158_carroll.pdf) 

**Review the [rubric for this assignment here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GQ8C0APsoIG1R9UQL-QGOtENYi413_Fv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111507336322611936333&rtpof=true&sd=true).** Answer at least one of the following questions for your reflection:

1.  The FAIR principles promote openness and accessibility, while the CARE principles emphasize control and ethics in Indigenous data. Can you think of an example where balancing openness with ethical considerations was or would have been important?

2. The CARE principles stress the authority of communities over their own data. In your own experience, who has typically held authority over data? How might shifting that authority impact the outcomes or perceptions of data projects you’ve been involved in?

3. How do the CARE principles challenge or expand your understanding of data management? Have you encountered situations —personally or professionally— where data governance might have benefited from a more community-centered approach?
