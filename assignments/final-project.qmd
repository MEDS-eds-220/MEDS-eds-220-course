## Task 1: Thomas Fire analysis blog post and accompanying analyses

In this task, you will transform your presentation-ready repository from Homework 4 into a polished blog post for your personal website and compile and streamline all its supporting notebooks.

### Purpose

Your blog post should showcase two out of the three data analysis exercises we did related to the Thomas Fire:

- Land cover statistics (November 27 exercises)
- Air Quality Index analysis (Hwk 2 - Task 3)
- False color image analysis (Hwk 4 - Task 2)

Your audience is a fellow Python programmer with beginner-to-intermediate geospatial wrangling experience. This is an opportunity to highlight your skills and communicate your analysis in a clear and engaging way! 

To help you understand the desired format and text-to-code ratio, review these examples:

- [https://julietcohen.github.io/posts/2021-12-24-sstsicpython/](https://julietcohen.github.io/posts/2021-12-24-sstsicpython/)

- [https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2023-03-arctic/sections/geopandas.html](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2023-03-arctic/sections/geopandas.html).

Take note of how they balance explanations, code, and visualizations to communicate their analyses effectively.

In addition to the blog post, the notebooks used for the data analysis should be part of your presentation-ready GitHub repository. These notebook contain work you have already completed and probably revised, so the effort should go into cleaning and streamlining them. 

### Guidelines

:::{.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
This task builds on your previous work. Your **first step** should be to carefully review the feedback you received on your notebooks and Homework 4 repository and make the necessary updates.

💡 If you have questions or need clarification on the feedback, don't hesitate to ask!
:::

Your post should be **streamlined**, focusing on the key steps and results. Avoid lengthy print checks and intermediate outputs, favoring concise, well-explained code chunks.

Your post should include (at least) the following:

- **About section:** 
  - Provide context for the analysis. Introduce the Thomas Fire, its significance, and the relevance of your analyses.
  - Include an image related to the analysis.
- **Highlights of analysis:**
  - List of highlights of analysis (3 or 4 highlights). What do you consider to be the most important techniques used or insights from the analysis?
- **Dataset descriptions:**
  - Describe the datasets you used and provide proper citations or references.

- **Link to GitHub repository:**
  - Include a link to your GitHub repository at the top of the post. The repository should be presentation-ready and contain the full, detailed analysis.

- **Organized data analysis sections:** 
  - Break the analysis into logical sections.
  - Include only the most relevant code.
  - Aim for a clean, professional layout with properly formatted code snippets and images.

- **Final visualizations:**
  -  Showcase your main visualizations with clear captions. Follow each visualization with a short description explaining its insights and relevance.

### Setup

:::{.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
You will expand the GitHub repository you created for homework 4 for this task by including the notebook with the other Thomas Fire data analysis into it.  Follow the repository structure below:

```default
repo-name  # Consider renaming, e.g., "thomas-fire-analysis"
│   README.md
|   notebooks  # One per analysis, clean and streamlined
|   .gitignore
│
└── data  # If needed
    │   data-files  
```
**Important notes:**

- Ensure **no .DS_Store or .ipynb_checkpoints** files are present in your repository.

- All notebooks should be streamlined and will be checked using the "notebooks organization" rubric.

The blog post itself will be created as a separate file within your personal website repository. 
<!-- TODO: add instructions about how to add python to blog -->

📋 Don't forget to read the [rubric for this task](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14_F9ez858bV0EFGoqDwd2_wfj8hwyxuz_cRoms73_M4/edit?usp=sharing) before you start working on it. 

💡 For your first blog post submission, it’s normal to receive feedback and a “needs revision” rating. Implementing the requested changes during resubmission can earn you 100% of the points. However, if no revised blog post is submitted, this task will count as 0%. Revising will be a crucial part of this task!

## Task 2: Biodiversity Intactness Index change in Phoenix, AZ

In 2021, Maricopa County —home to the Phoenix metropolitan area— was identified as the U.S. county with the most significant increase in developed land since 2001 @levitt_where_2021. This rapid urban sprawl has profound implications for biodiversity and the health of surrounding natural ecosystems.

In this assignment, you will investigate the impacts of urban expansion by analyzing a dataset that captures values for the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) @gassert_global_2022. Your task is to examine changes in BII in the Phoenix county subdivision area between 2017 and 2020, shedding light on how urban growth affects biodiversity over time.

### About the data

In this task you will use two datasets. 


You will work with two datasets for this task:

1. **Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) Time Series**
Access the `io-biodiversity` collection from the [Microsoft Planetary Computer STAC catalog](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/io-biodiversity). Use the 2017 and 2020 rasters covering the Phoenix subdivision. For the bounding box, use the following coordinates:
```default
[-112.826843, 32.974108, -111.184387, 33.863574]
```

2. **Phoenix Subdivision Shapefile**
Download the Phoenix subdivision polygon from the Census County Subdivision shapefiles for Arizona.

To enhance your data exploration, you may use additional shapefiles or rasters to create a map situating the Phoenix subdivision within its broader geographic context.

### Setup

:::{.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
First, read all the instructions and rubric for this task. Then, create a new GitHub repository to house the work for this task. Choose an adequate, informative title for your repository (not `EDS220-final-project`). Your repository should have the following structure:

```default
repo-name
│   README.md
|   notebooks
|   .gitignore
│
└── data  # If needed
    │   data-files  
```

In particular, there should be **no .DS_Store or .ipynb_checkpoints** files in your repository.

## Instructions

### 1. Data analysis

1. Explore the data and write a brief summary of the information you obtained from the preliminary information. 

2. Create a map showing the Phoenix subdivision within its broader geographic context. You may use any vector or raster datasets to create your map. Be sure to include citations or descriptions for these datasets at the top of your notebook too. You may also want to check out the `contextily` package to add a base map.

3. Calculate the *percentage* of area of the Phoenix subdivision with a BII of at least 0.75 in 2017. Obtain the same calculation for 2020. Before you start coding, take a moment to write step-by-step instructions for yourself about how to get this result. You don't need to include these in your notebook, but you should have a plan before starting your code.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## HINTS (useful or not depending on your workflow)

- Let `x` be an `xarray.DataArray`. We can select all the values greater than `n` by simply doing `x>n`. 
- Make sure you are calculating the percentage over the Phoenix area, and not the complete raster extent.
:::

4. Create a visualization showing the area with BII>=0.75 in 2017 that was lost by 2020. Here’s an example:

<p align="center">
![](/assignments/images/bii_phoenix.png){width="60%"}
</p>

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## HINTS (useful or not depending on your workflow)

- To find which pixels changed value from 2017 to 2020 think about the following example. Which values in R3 represent areas that had BII>=0.75 in 2017 but not in 2020?

<p align="center">
![](/assignments/images/bii_raster_math.png){width="70%"}
</p>

- You can plot multiple rasters in the same figure. NaN values will be transparent.
:::

5. Under your BII visualization write a brief description of the results you obtianed in this task. 

### 2. Clean notebook

The target audience for your notebook is a fellow EDS 220 student who is just learning geospatial wrangling using Python. 

- Add enough and appropriate comments to explain your code.
- First cell in the notebook must be a markdown cell including: 
  - [ ] Title
  - [ ] Author
  - [ ] Link to GitHub repository containing the notebook (for grading purposes)
- At the top of the notebook, include an "About" section with the following subsections: 
    - [ ] Purpose: what is this notebook about?
    - [ ] Highlights: List of highlights of analysis (3 or 4 highlights). What do you consider to be the most important aspects of this coding exercise?
    - [ ] About the data: Datasets description
    - [ ] References: Formal references to datasets. You can use the APA style as outlined [here](https://library.cumc.columbia.edu/insight/citing-data-sources).
- The rest of your notebook should have:
    - [ ] Logical subsections (indicated through markdown headers) for the data exploration, analysis, and visualization you are performing. The subsections should easily guide the reader through the analysis.
    - [ ] Enough and appropriate **markdown cells to explain the procedures you are using and their output**. Copy-pasting the instructions in markdown cells is not appropriate. If your code comment is getting too long, you should probably move it to markdown cell as text. 

### 3. Clean repository 

Same as the instructions for assignment 4. Update your repository's README with (at least) the following (based on [EDS 296](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/README-guidelines/)):

- [ ] **Title.** Short, but descriptive title.
- [ ] **"About" section.** A brief explanation of the repository’s purpose.
  Paragraphs or a bulleted list are both acceptable options. 
  You may include an image or logo that represents the project.
- [ ] **"Repository Structure" section.** A concise description of what’s housed in the repository.
  This includes information about the repository structure or file organization.
- [ ] **"Data" section.** Details regarding data access. Any necessary information on where data lives (e.g. is it housed in the repo, on a server, in a library / package etc.) and how to access it in order to run the code. 
- [ ] **"References" section.** In an appropriate, consistent format, including links, provide a reference to the course and any other sources that supported the development of the repository. **Include formal references to the datasets.** You can use the APA style to cite data sources as outlined [here](https://library.cumc.columbia.edu/insight/citing-data-sources).
